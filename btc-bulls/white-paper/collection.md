# COLLECTION

### ****![](../../.gitbook/assets/47.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/62.png)****

### **A collection of 10,000 BTC Bull NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.**&#x20;

* No whitelist; You are in because you want to be, not who you know
* Lifetime access to the mining cluster's rewards\*
* First dibs on future project partnerships
* Receive an airdrop of our Native Token when it launches
* Initial Raffle opportunity upon minting a BTC Bull and long-term raffle opportunities through Royalty Raffle
*   &#x20;23 BTC Bulls are considered 'enlightened' and thus the rarest!&#x20;

    * 'Enlightened' BTC Bulls are any bulls with a Little Amigo
    * BTC Bulls are revealed after each TEIR sells out
    * Once revealed, 'Enlightened' BTC Bulls are maintenance fee exempt moving forward\*\* &#x20;
    * The location of each 'Enlightened' BTC Bull is unknown to all, including the creator. We know how many exist in the collection, not where they reside&#x20;

\*Lifetime means as long the project sustains itself and/or until the year 2040 when we can no longer mine bitcoin.  &#x20;

\*\*Submit a ticket showing NFT in Discord. The contract gets updated with the NFT number, and then maintenance exclusion starts.&#x20;
