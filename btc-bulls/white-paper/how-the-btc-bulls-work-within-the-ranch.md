# HOW THE BTC BULLS WORK WITHIN THE RANCH

## 10,000 FT VIEW OF 10,000 BTC BULLS

The BTC Bulls community is built around Bitcoin Mining. This project is a hybrid of a MAAS (mining-as-a-service) and a club. The Ranch itself is a community-driven ecosystem, each member is expected to pull their own weight for the betterment of the community as a whole. The key point of the BTC Bulls is buying an NFT which are means of buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster.

&#x20;



## TOKENOMICS&#x20;

The Ranch BTC Bulls does NOT have its own native token by design. The only tokens this project will use:&#x20;

* BTC (BITCOIN)
  * BTC is used as the BTC mining reward token that is received for our mining efforts.&#x20;
* WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN)
  * WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and allows us to payout out thousands of NFTs within the project.&#x20;
* USDC&#x20;
  * Used to Mint the NFTs and also the reward token used in THE DROVE partner network and Daily Raffles.&#x20;
* MATIC &#x20;
  * This is the native token of Polygon and each user must have it to use for gas when interacting with the smart contract.&#x20;

## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Networking (1).svg>) BTC BULL CENTRALITY

Ownership of a BTC BULL is the central part of this project. There will be other assets deployed within the ecosystem but all assets a tied back to the BTC Bulls. For example, let's say we deploy Llama's within the ranch that will be invested into another project to create revenue for us. Each Llama NFT would be rewarded, pro-rata, but the funds are sent back to the BTC Bulls contract and go through this logic to update USDC amounts for the BTC Bulls.

## MAINTENANCE FEES



The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $5K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. I would predict that there are 100 scam opportunities for every genuine one. After all the dust has settled on our research, we have been happy with one company in particular, Compass Mining.  At Compass mining and other facilities, they sell BTC miners with and without hosting or sometimes offer bundle packages that give buyers the best rate for each unit coupled with the best hosting/electricity fee. Hosting at the right facilities is a crucial part of this project. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s,  the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I personally am having to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what the hosting facilities, Compass Mining included, can offer us because they are making deals with the electric companies and/or providing other renewable energy options to keep the price down at the $0.07 - $0.08 range and sometimes lower.

But what about the MAINTENANCE FEES? What is this and why is this important? Let's play out an example of how this project will go. We start selling the project the BTC Bull NFTs and purchase miners from the onset. We go through the first phase of selling and we sell 2500 BTC Bulls at $350 each. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle, which would send  \~ $787,500 to the BTC MINER FUND.&#x20;

* BTC MINER FUND = (2500 x 350) \* 0.90   == $787,500
* RAFFLE = (2500 x 350) \* 0.03 == $26,250
* PARTNER NETWORK = (2500 x 350) \* 0.02 == $17,500
* HOSTING FEE WAR CHEST= (2500 x 350) \* 0.05 == $43,750



The way the hosting works at the mining and hosting facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner they host. Each S19j Pro costs about $166.90 per month to host. Why so expensive? Firstly the cost of electricity, it would cost you more to run this at your house in electricity alone. Secondly, they provide 24/7 security and optimal warehouse conditions for each miner. &#x20;



The BTC MINER FUND is then used to purchase and start building the project's BTC MINER CLUSTER (simply a huge group of miners is all). When factoring in tax or other transaction expenses, that starts the BTC MINER CLUSTER off with about 150 s19j Pro miners or about 15,000 TH/s of mining power. The foundational part of this project is each BTC bull carrying their own weight and helping out the community around them. When mining Bitcoin in a bear market or bull market, we do **NOT** want to convert our monthly BTC rewards back only to pay for the hosting invoice for the month. The point of the project is to retain as much of a  Bitcoin as possible as we head into the future. Since Bitcoin is deflationary, there will never be more than 21,000,000 tokens in existence and retaining as much as we can for each NFT is the goal.&#x20;

#### SO HOW DOES THE PROJECT PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

Each NFT on the project is required to share the hosting invoice. In the current example, 150 miners on the invoice would be \~ $25,000. Since we have 2500 BTC Bulls in circulation, each BTC Bull NFT will share that invoice and is required to pay $10 in maintenance fees for the month. WBTC withdrawing from the contract will require each address to have a zero balance due for their maintenance fees before WBTC withdrawing is allowed. &#x20;

As the project opens up phase 2 and allows more minting up the 5000th NFT, this changes the maintenance fees accordingly. For the sake of this example, we would purchase more miners to add in to the BTC MINING CLUSTER but that could take up to 30-60 days to come online. In the very next month, it is very likely that there would still only be 150 miners being hosted at the facility and thus an expected invoice is still at \~$25,000. How that 5000 BTC Bull NFTs are in existence, that invoice is now shared amongst 5000 and lowering each BTC Bull Maintenance fee for the month down to \~ $5

The next month bring online 70 more miners, then we would be sharing a \~$37,700 invoice amongst 5000 BTC bulls, putting each BTC Bull maintenance fee for the month at about $7.30



## HOW DOES A USER PAY THEIR MAINTENANCE FEES?

![Fig 4](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png>)

When paying monthly maintenance fees, each transaction will go through this logic process. If a user has enough USDC rewards on their account, the maintenance fees amount can and will be deducted from them when paying the maintenance fees. Otherwise, each user will need to pay the maintenance fees from their own wallet using USDC.e



## WAR CHEST

As noted in the Minting figures (Fig 1 and Fig 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the WAR CHEST. This money is reserved for hosting fee invoices.  When the project starts, the first month's invoices will be paid using this WAR CHEST. Each month when users pay their maintenance fees, that money goes to replenish the WAR CHEST. &#x20;

A very important concept and design on the project revolves around the WAR CHEST and what happens if the WAR CHEST were to run out of money. As every user is required to pay their maintenance fees before being allowed to withdraw the WBTC rewards, this should take care of itself. If we are still in a deficit, this problem will likely crop up if enough users are not paying their maintenance fees over time. If this scenario does play out, we will have to use a portion of our monthly mining rewards to cover the invoice. The Ranch has simple ground rules to comply with; pay your fees to help yourself and the community alike. There is **NO** plan to punish all holders of BTC Bulls if this were to happen. This is why there is a liquidation function in the contract.&#x20;

#### HOW IS THE LIQUIDATION FUNCTION USED?

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

When funds are deposited back into the smart contract and NFTs are rewarded in the pro-rata format, variables and mappings are updated on the contract. If a user is 4 months behind on paying monthly maintenance fees, that user will get liquidated. In this project, that means that the past 4 WBTC deposits made into that account will be sent to the WAR CHEST. That is the BTC that will be used to pay for invoices in the absence of users paying maintenance fees. If this does happen to a user, the months behind and total maintenance fees due variables are reset back to zero. The next month will be as if that user has started fresh on the contract and will only be 1 month behind on their maintenance fees (after that month's rewards are dispersed).&#x20;



## HOW LONG WILL THE BTC BULLS LAST?&#x20;



We are setting ourselves up to mine Bitcoin until the very last day possible. Each BTC Bull be working on The Ranch until that day happens in the year 2040. At that point, each BTC Bull will eventually lose its mission of mining BTC. As with everything that happens on The Ranch, we can always pivot and find another use case for the Bulls. They are beloved in our community and will not be abandoned. Each holder in the future can vote on what they shall do on their next challenge of life.&#x20;

![The year 2040 will bring an end to BTC mining and each BTC Bull will pivot to another assignment. ](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png>)



## HOW LONG DOES EACH MINER LAST AND WHAT IS DONE WHEN THEY FAIL?



We are projecting each miner to be operational for 60 months. Some will last longer and others will fail before that time. When designing the project, we had two options. 1. Take 100% of all the mining rewards coming from Compass Mining and disperse those to the community or 2. Take a percentage of the mining Rewards Monthly and continue buying more miners for the project. Had we gone with option 1, the Bulls would die around 60 months. The goal of the project mine Bitcoin until the very end and turning back a portion of the monthly profits to buy more miners is how we are going to do that. We are going to use 1/3 of all monthly rewards to purchase more miners. 2/3 of that monthly reward amount is then dispersed into the contract and distributed according to figure 2 above. &#x20;

#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MINERS DO DIE THOUGH?

When this happens, it's a best effort attempt to get the most money we can from selling them back to Compass Mining or on a third-party platform. All revenue generated from the selling of a miner is dispersed back into the project according to figure 2. Miners will inevitably die, hundreds if not thousands of miners will die during this project. That's why we will constantly be buying more miners as we turn 1/3 of monthly rewards back into new purchase orders.&#x20;



## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Raffle Drawing Machine.svg>) RAFFLE



![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRF v2 and Chainlinks Keepers service.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability. [https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/)
* What is Chainlink Keepers? We are automating the contract using **Chainlink Keepers**, the decentralized and highly reliable smart contract automation service. Relying on Chainlink Keepers to automate the contract allows the Raffle to be called every 24 hrs without any intervention needed from the contract owner if someone has minted a new NFT during the day. [https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/introduction/](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/introduction/)



When minting new NFTs, each user can voluntarily choose to enter the Daily Raffle where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the daily winner. As long as 1 new NFT was minted for the day, the raffle is allowed to happen and the function will be called. At the end of the count down, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC that is allowed to be withdrawn from the contract from that user.&#x20;



## PAUSING OF THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

#### WBTC WITHDRAWS:&#x20;

During the first couple days of each month between the 1st to 5th day of each month, all the Bitcoin rewards will be withdrawn from our Compass Mining account and converted to WBTC. When the WBTC is deposited into the contract and dispersed to NFTs owners, All WBTC withdraws will be paused during this time. While the contract updates every account during this process, it is important to make sure all accounts are static and not in the middle of any transaction.&#x20;

#### MINTING NEW NFTS

During the daily raffle that happens every 24 hours, The minting function will pause and no longer allow any new mints for a few minutes. This is to allow the daily raffle function to work correctly without any data changing mid-process.  &#x20;
