## BITCOIN MINING&#x20;

#### 4 KEY TAKEAWAYS:&#x20;

1. BTC Mining is the central part of The Ranch. Starting the project in or near the bottom of the bear market is an advantage that can't be overlooked.  The ability for the team to buy miners for a fraction of the price and lock in better hosting rates will pay dividends down the road that wouldn't have been seen otherwise.
2. The other part of the project that needs to be stressed is the amount of net profit that we will see. A foundational decision for the project was **NOT** to convert our mined BITCOIN to pay for hosting fees. Spending a few bucks in UDSC.e every month to cover the hosting fees (this is what our maintenance fees cover) will prove to be the differentiating factor that sets this project apart from other BTC mining projects. This helps us retain as much BTC as possible and increases the amount of BTC we can disperse back to NFT holders.&#x20;
3. All BTC mined goes back to the project and gets dispersed, according to [FIG 3](../the-ranch-101.md#monthly-btc-mining-rewards). We are **NOT** taking a portion out of the monthly revenue to invest in alt-coins or other investments. There will be opportunities within our ecosystem for alt-coin mining, alt-coins, and external promising projects, but they will be optional to partake in (see [additional revenue streams](../the-ranch-101.md#additional-revenue-streams)). This allows us to retain as much BTC as possible and, more importantly, disperse as much BTC/WBTC back to each NFT holder.&#x20;
4. BTC/WBTC will be dispersed back to NFT holders in the first month of operation. We will not withhold paying out NFT holders for months while we compound our mining efforts. We have built in the 1/3 reinvestment/compound strategy for this exact reason.&#x20;
