# VISION

## The Ranch:&#x20;

#### First and Foremost, if this project doesn't provide value to the participants then this project is an absolute failure on my part.&#x20;

#### Transparency. As a community member, events, contracts, and decisions will be transparent to anyone and everyone who cares to know. If you want to know where each dollar goes within the project, it's there for viewing. Handle as much as you can through smart contracts and on the blockchain. &#x20;

## BTC BULLS:&#x20;

#### Mine bitcoin as a group as we fractionalize the buy-in process, pooling our resources together, allowing all of us to take part in premium equipment bundle packages that have been previously reserved for only the wealthier individuals and businesses to take part in. The BTC Bulls plan to be around until the year 2040, when Bitcoin is no longer mineable. Since Bitcoin is deflationary, there will never be more than 21,000,000 tokens in existence and retaining as much as we can for each BTC Bull is the goal.&#x20;

#### The BTC Bulls hold the most power within The Ranch ecosystem because they were the first to live on The Ranch itself and thus have seniority. All other animals that join The Ranch essentially have to look up to the Bulls and pay respect to them, making it more profitable to own a Bull if you own other animals within The Ranch ecosystem.&#x20;
