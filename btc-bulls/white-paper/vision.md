# VISION

## The Ranch:&#x20;

#### First and Foremost, if this project doesn't provide value to the participants then this project is an absolute failure on my part.&#x20;

#### Transparency. As a member of the community, events, contracts, and decisions will be totally transparent to anyone and everyone who cares to know. If you want to know where each dollar goes within the project, it's there for viewing.&#x20;

## BTC BULLS:&#x20;

#### Mine bitcoin as a group as we fractionalize the buy-in process, pooling our resources together allowing all of us to take part in premium equipment bundle packages that have been previously reserved for only the wealthier individuals and businesses to take part in. The BTC Bulls plan to be around until the year 2040 when Bitcoin is no longer mineable. They'll learn to pivot at that point.&#x20;
