# ADDITIONAL STREAMS OF REVENUE

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

The smart contract for the BTC Bulls was built with future streams of revenue in mind for each BTC Bull. One additional idea of the roadmap for the project is releasing Hay Bale NFTs that will support the USDC balance of each BTC Bull. The end goal is to cover all maintenance fees for each owner and created a surplus in that area. Shortly after the launch of the BTC Bulls, all potential revenue ideas will be vetted with trusted individuals in the crypto space and legal counsel.&#x20;
