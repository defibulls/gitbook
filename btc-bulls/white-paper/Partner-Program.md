# THE PARTNER-NETWORK

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System-01 (1).png>)

The Partner-Network is an onboarding system that benefits team builders and new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is completely voluntary, however by utilizing the Partner-Network, not only are participants rewarded for building out their teams organically but newcomers are provided equal incentive to participate. Unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new BTC Bull NFTs or during the monthly payout of WBTC to NFT holders. 2% of the minting transaction cost will be given to the partner of the referred person. During monthly WBTC payouts, 2% of the total rewards payout for the owner's NFTS is split 50/50, or 1% each, between the referred and referrer and uploaded to the amount that each is allowed to withdraw from the contract. In order to receive the partner network bonus, the person who is set as your partner must have minted an NFT themself.&#x20;

## PARTNER TAB

In order to add your own partner to the Drove, you must enter your partner's wallet address and click the “Update” button. Once you’ve set a partner, you will begin to benefit by receiving partner credits during monthly WBTC payouts. 2% WBTC rewards payout amount is split 50/50, or 1% each, between the referred and referrer (set partner) and uploaded to the amount that each is allowed to withdraw from the contract. You are able to update your active partner address at any time.

## TEAM CHECKER TAB

&#x20;The checker tool allows you to verify if an address is directly on your Drove team.&#x20;

## ELIGIBILITY TAB

&#x20;The eligibility tab allows you to verify if your partner has minted an NFT from the contract before, which would make them an eligible partner for you to reap the benefits from the Partner-Network.
