# ROYALTIES

## ROYALTY REWARDS

There will be a 12.5% royalty fee when selling BTC Bulls on OpenSea.  2.5% gets paid to OpenSea as a fee, and the remaining 10% is split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Rewards Events and rewards helps inflate the DGGT tokens price.&#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, this could serve as a cool approach to reward those who supported first and stayed around.
