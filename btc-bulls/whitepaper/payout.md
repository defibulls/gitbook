## QUARTERLY BTC MINING REWARDS

All BTC mining efforts will be processed quarterly.

Mining Rewards will be paid out in WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN). WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and pay out the TR Bull NFTs within the project.&#x20;

### Disbursement Strategy:

**50%** of all earned mining rewards will be converted to WBTC and deposited into the respective smart contract of the TR Bulls. When deposited into the smart contract, The funds are dispersed to the owners of the TR Bulls NFTs in pro-rata format. Using this approach, each NFT is awarded the same amount. An address owning 5 NFTs would get 5x more WBTC rewards than a wallet address owning a single NFT.

**40%** goes into the investment wallet. These funds will be used to invest in other projects, real-world assets, tokens, etc. Members of the DAO will vote on all investment decisions.

**10%** goes back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, overhead management, and marketing.&#x20;

_This is also the generalized approach for all investments we make as a community._&#x20;
