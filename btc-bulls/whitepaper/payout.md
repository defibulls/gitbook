## QUARTERLY BTC MINING REWARDS

All BTC mining efforts will be processed quarterly between the 1st and 5th of that given month for the BTC Bull communities.&#x20;

Mining Rewards will be paid out in WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN). WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and pay out thousands of NFTs within the project.&#x20;

### Starting and Bear market compounding strategy:

**1/3** of all earned mining rewards received from the mining facility will be reinvested back into the mining cluster to purchase more BTC miners.&#x20;

**2/3** of all earned mining rewards will be converted to WBTC and deposited into the respective smart contract of the BTC Bulls. When deposited into the smart contract, 10% goes back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, and marketing. The remaining 90% is then dispersed to the owners of the BTC Bulls NFTs in pro-rata format. Using this approach, each NFT is awarded the same amount. An address owning 5 NFTs would get 5x more WBTC rewards than a wallet address owning a single NFT.

### Bull market compounding strategy:

Using the **1/3** and **2/3** approaches discussed above is going to be the way the project starts. This approach is an ideal ratio to help grow the number of miners working for us. However, this is not written in stone by design. When we move back into a Bull Market, and the price of BTC nears and surpasses its all-time high prices, it doesn't make sense for the project to keep pulling **1/3** back to reinvest into miners. We will open this to a vote within each community on the best way to approach this as it nears.

We are planning to shift to a 100% reward structure when the price of BTC surpasses $50K. This will be put to the vote within each community when the time comes to solidify the exact percentage of distribution. The intent will be to let NFT owners capitalize on the price action of BTC when the time comes.&#x20;
