#### All BTC Bulls will be purchased with TRT. The amount of TRT needed to mint a BTC Bull will not change during the presales and public sales. However, the cost to obtain the needed TRT will change.&#x20;

* Without being whitelisted, each BTC Bull will cost 150 TRT.&#x20;
* To be whitelisted, follow Discord and Twitter announcements. There is no limit to the number of wallets that can be whitelisted, but there are simple requirements to do so.
  * When whitelisted, the overall cost of NFTs does change for two reasons.  &#x20;
    * Purchasing 1 or 2 during a single transaction gives you a 20% discount, where each BTC Bull will cost 120 TRT.&#x20;
    * The value is added when purchasing 3, 5, 7, or 9 BTC Bulls in a single transaction because we mint more BTC Bulls to your wallet as a Bonus.&#x20;
      * Minting 3 BTC Bulls would cost 336 TRT; however, you would receive 4 BTC Bulls, and the price would average out to be 300 each.&#x20;
      * Minting 9 BTC Bulls would cost 927 TRT; however, you would receive 13 BTC Bulls, and the price would average out to be 103 each.&#x20;

## COST DISTRIBUTION WHEN BUYING WITH TRT:&#x20;

* 80% of the transaction goes to the BTC MINERS SAFE to purchase miners at the hosting facility.&#x20;
* 11% is sent to the War Chest, the multi-sig wallet serving as our war chest for the BTC Bulls. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project.&#x20;
  * "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail" is the motto we stand behind when it comes to our war chest model.
* 6% is held for the Rarity Airdrops for Bulls with Frogs and Turtles.
* 2% goes to the Buddy of the address minting NFTs.
* 1% goes to MARKETING.

## COST DISTRIBUTION WHEN BUYING WITH A CREDIT CARD

The smart contract itself can support purchasing with credit cards via paper.xyz

* 80% of the transaction goes to the BTC MINERS SAFE to purchase miners at the hosting facility.&#x20;
* 13% is sent to the War Chest. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project. A project failing to prepare is a project preparing to fail.&#x20;
* 6% is held for the Rarity AirDrop Payout.
* 1% goes to Marketing.

_When using a credit card to purchase BTC Bulls, the buddy system awarding is skipped and will not be counted as the paper.xyz will allow you to mint with a paper wallet and then transfer to a wallet of your choice._&#x20;
