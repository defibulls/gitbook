#### All TR Bulls will be purchased with $TRT. The amount of $TRT needed to mint a TR Bull will not change during the presales and public sales. However, the cost to obtain the needed $TRT will change due to the token appreciation mechanics of $TRT itself.&#x20;

* Without being whitelisted, each TR Bull will cost 150 $TRT.&#x20;
* To be whitelisted, follow Discord and Twitter announcements.&#x20;
  * When whitelisted, the overall cost of TR Bull NFTs does change for two reasons.  &#x20;
    * Purchasing 1 or 2 during a single transaction gives you a 20% discount, where each TR Bull will cost 120 $TRT.&#x20;
    * The Bonus NFTs get added when purchasing 3, 5, 7, or 9 TR Bulls in a single transaction because we mint more TR Bulls to your wallet as a Bonus.&#x20;
      * Minting 3 TR Bulls would cost 450 $TRT; however, you would receive 4 TR Bulls, and the price for each TR Bull averages out to be 112 $TRT.&#x20;
      * Minting 9 TR Bulls would cost 1350 $TRT; however, you would receive 13 TR Bulls, and the price for each TR Bull averages out to be 103 $TRT. &#x20;

## COST DISTRIBUTION WHEN BUYING WITH TRT:&#x20;

* 80% of the transaction goes to the BTC MINERS SAFE to purchase miners at the hosting facility.&#x20;
* 11% is sent to the War Chest, the multi-sig wallet serving as our war chest for the BTC Bulls. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project.&#x20;
  * "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail" is the motto we stand behind when it comes to our war chest model.
* 6% is held for the Rarity Airdrops for Bulls with Frogs and Turtles.
* 2% goes to the Buddy of the address minting NFTs.
* 1% goes to MARKETING.

## COST DISTRIBUTION WHEN BUYING WITH A CREDIT CARD

The smart contract itself can support purchasing with credit cards via paper.xyz

* 80% of the transaction goes to the BTC MINERS SAFE to purchase miners at the hosting facility.&#x20;
* 13% is sent to the War Chest. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project. A project failing to prepare is a project preparing to fail.&#x20;
* 6% is held for the Rarity AirDrop Payout.
* 1% goes to Marketing.

_When using a credit card to purchase TR Bulls, the buddy system reward is bypassed and will not be counted as the paper.xyz will allow you to mint with a paper wallet and then transfer to a wallet of your choice._&#x20;
