# GATHERING $TRT FOR MINTING

Minting the TR Bulls of the project, the OG Bulls on our land, is starting the ecosystem to include the presale of the native token we are building, $TRT. Once we start minting TR Bulls on March 30 @ 7 PM, this also kicks off the presale of the $TRT Token.&#x20;

Right off the bat, everyone is allotted a $TRT presale allowance of 750 $TRT Tokens. To Mint TR Bulls, you must obtain $TRT first, as that is the ERC20 token used to mint the TR Bulls on our Dapp.&#x20;

The only way to increase the presale allowance of $TRT a user can buy is to mint TR Bulls. After every minting transaction, the presale allowance of $TRT is increased for the user based solely on the minting transaction cost. To be exact, the $TRT presale allowance is increased by 3x to the minting transaction cost. &#x20;

#### _What is a presale allowance?_ &#x20;

_This is the amount of $TRT Tokens a user can buy during the presale of $TRT before we open it up to everyone to buy and start using it for all the other parts of the project. No one can buy any more than their presale allowance._&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:purple;">Everyone has to navigate the $TRT gathering quest.</mark> In the following rudimentary example, we will walk through a user, Alice, minting during the first presale phase, which is capped at 250 TR Bulls to be minted during this phase. Note that this example doesn't consider the buying fees associated with $TRT and assumes Alice is not whitelisted.&#x20;

## Presale 1 (phase 1) starts, allowing 250 TR Bulls to be minted.

Alice starts with 5,000 USDC in her wallet and a 750 $TRT presale allowance. She buys 750 $TRT in exchange for 750 USDC from our Dapp.&#x20;

* 4,250 USDC, the amount currently in her wallet.
* 750 $TRT in her wallet
* A $TRT presale allowance is reduced to 0.&#x20;

Alice mints the most TR Bulls she can with her $TRT holding. Each TR Bull costs 150 $TRT, so she can mint a maximum of five TR Bulls costing 750 $TRT (5 \* 150 == 750).&#x20;

* 4,250 USDC, the amount currently in her wallet.
* 0 $TRT in her wallet
* 5 TR Bull NFTs
* A $TRT presale allowance of 2,250 (3x minting transaction cost).&#x20;

Alice doesn't have enough $TRT to buy another TR Bull NFT. She purchases her new max $TRT presale allowance of 2,250 $TRT tokens.&#x20;

* Her new wallet total is 2,000 USDC
* 2,250 $TRT in her wallet
* 5 TR Bulls NFTs
* A $TRT presale allowance of 0.&#x20;

Alice now mints as many TR Bulls as she can; 9 is the max she mint in a single transaction (9 \* 150 == 1350). Having 900 $TRT left, she then mints seven more ( 7 \* 150 == 900) in a separate transaction.&#x20;

* Her new total is 2,000 USDC
* 0 $TRT in her wallet
* 21 TR Bull NFTs (5+ 9 + 7)&#x20;
* A $TRT presale allowance of 7,200.
  * 9 \* 150 \* 3 == 4,050
  * 7 \* 150 \* 3 == 3,150
    * 4,050 + 3,150 == 7200

Alice purchases the max amount of $TRT she can with the amount of USDC she has left.&#x20;

* Her new total is 0 USDC
* 2000 $TRT in her wallet
* 21 TR Bull NFTs
* $TRT presale allowance of 5200 (7,200 - 2000 == 5,200)

Alice now mints as many TR Bull NFTs as she can, which is the max anyone can mint in a single transaction, 9 TR Bulls for 1350 $TRT. Having 650 $TRT left, she mints three more TR Bulls for 450 $TRT.&#x20;

* Her new total is 0 USDC
* 200 $TRT in her wallet
* 33 TR Bull NFTs (5+ 9 + 7 + 9 + 3)&#x20;
* $TRT presale allowance of 10,600
  * 5200 remaining before the last minting transaction
  * 9 \* 150 \* 3 == 4,050
  *   3 \* 150 \* 3 == 1,350

      * 5,200 + 4,050 + 1,350 == 10,600



## Presale 1 (phase 1) stops as 250 BTC Bulls are minted from Alice and others.&#x20;

Alice has a phase 1 mint count of 33 TR Bulls. She will be airdropped 1 TR Bull with a guaranteed Turtle if that's the most mints during this phase.&#x20;

Alices' overall mint count is 33 BTC Bulls.&#x20;



## Presale 2 (phase 2) starts to allow an additional 400 TR Bulls to be minted.&#x20;

Alices' phase mint count is reset to 0 for the start of phase 2.&#x20;

Alice's overall mint count remains 33; this is never reset.&#x20;
