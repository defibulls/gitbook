# GATHERING TRT

Minting the OG's of the project, The BTC Bulls is also starting the ecosystem in general to include the presale of the native token we are building, TRT. Once we start minting BTC Bulls on March 30 @ 7 PM, this also kicks off the presale of the TRT Token.&#x20;

Right off the bat, everyone is allotted a TRT presale allowance of 1000 TRT Tokens. To Mint BTC Bulls, you must obtain TRT first, as that is the ERC20 token used to mint.&#x20;

The only way to increase the allowance of TRT a user is allowed to buy is to mint BTC Bulls. After every minting transaction, the presale allowance of TRT is increased for the user based solely on the minting transaction cost. To be exact, the TRT presale allowance is increased by 3x the minting transaction cost. &#x20;

#### _What is a presale allowance?_ &#x20;

_This is the amount a user is allowed to buy during the presale of TRT before we open it up to everyone to buy. They can't be any more than their allowance._&#x20;



Everyone in the project has to navigate the TRT gathering quest. In the following rudimentary example, we will walk through a user minting during the first presale, which is capped at 250 BTC Bulls Minted.&#x20;

## Presale 1 (phase 1) starts, allowing 250 BTC Bulls to be minted.

Alice starts with 10,000 USDC and a 1000 TRT presale allowance. She buys 1000 TRT for 1000 USDC.&#x20;

* Her new total is 9,000 USDC, 1000 TRT, and a TRT presale allowance is reduced to 0.&#x20;

Alice mints the most BTC Bulls she can with her TRT holding. Each BTC Bull costs 400 TRT, so that she can mint only two BTC Bulls costing 800 TRT.&#x20;

* Her new total is 9,000 USDC, 200 TRT, 2 BTC Bulls, and a TRT presale allowance of 2400.&#x20;

Alice doesn't have enough to buy another BTC Bull, instead purchases her max TRT presale allowance of 2400 TRT tokens.&#x20;

* Her new total is 6,600 USDC, 2600 TRT, 2 BTC Bulls, and a TRT presale allowance of 0.&#x20;

Alice now mints as many BTC Bulls as she can, 5 is the max she mint in a single transaction (5 \* 400 == 2000). Minting seven would be too much as that is 2800 TRT. Since she whitelisted herself, she gets two bonus NFTs.

* Her new total is 6,600 USDC, 600 TRT, 9 BTC Bulls, and a TRT presale allowance of 6000.

Alice purchases her max TRT presale allowance of 6000 TRT tokens.&#x20;

* Her new total is 600 USDC, 6600 TRT, 9 BTC Bulls, and a TRT presale allowance of 0.

Alice now mints as many BTC Bulls as she can, which is the max anyone can mint in a single transaction, 9 BTC Bulls for 3600 TRT. Since she whitelisted herself, she gets four bonus NFTs during the transaction.

* Her new total is 600 USDC, 3000 TRT, 22 BTC Bulls, and a TRT presale allowance of 10,800.



## Presale 1 (phase 1) stops as 250 BTC Bulls are minted.&#x20;

Alice has a phase 1 mint count of 22 BTC Bulls. She will be airdropped 1 BTC Bull with a guaranteed Turtle if that's the most mints for the phase.&#x20;

Alices' overall mint count is 22 BTC Bulls.&#x20;



## Presale 2 (phase 2) starts to allow 400 BTC Bulls to be minted.&#x20;

Alices' phase mint count is reset to 0.&#x20;

Alice's overall mint count remains 22.&#x20;
