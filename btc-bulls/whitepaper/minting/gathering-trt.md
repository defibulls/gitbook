# GATHERING TRT

Minting the OG's of the project, The BTC Bulls is also starting the ecosystem in general to include the presale of the native token we are building, TRT. Once we start minting BTC Bulls on March 30 @ 7 PM, this also kicks off the presale of the TRT Token.&#x20;

Right off the bat, everyone is allotted a TRT presale allowance of 1000 TRT Tokens. To Mint BTC Bulls, you must obtain TRT first, as that is the ERC20 token used to mint.&#x20;

The only way to increase the allowance of TRT a user is allowed to buy is to mint BTC Bulls. After every minting transaction, the presale allowance of TRT is increased for the user based solely on the minting transaction cost. To be exact, the TRT presale allowance is increased by 2x the minting transaction cost. &#x20;
