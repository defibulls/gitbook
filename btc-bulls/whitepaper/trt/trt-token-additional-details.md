# TRT Token - Additional Details

The TRT token is 100% Backed and will always have a backing. There are no algorithmic or inflationary mechanisms, as every token in circulation must be bought (minted).

* When liquidity is added to DEXâ€™s you may end up paying more or having to sell for less than what is on the dApp and vice versa. The price in our dApp will be the true value of $TRT, and that value will always increase!
* Once LP is added, and trading enabled on the open market outside of our dApp, arbitrage opportunities may arise.
  * These will present unique strategies for traders and can be compared to something like UST and Luna arbitrage but without any of the pitfalls of a completely algorithmic-backed token or even a stablecoin whose price is pegged to a fiat currency.
  * Although $TRT is backed by a stablecoin, the $TRT token itself is not pegged. This means arbitrage opportunities and inefficiencies in the market will offer traders the chance to try to profit from arbitrage across multiple DEXs, further driving up the volume to buy and sell $TRT.

Both Buying and Selling will cause price appreciation.

There will be no capped supply.

* Supply is determined by mint/buying and selling volume.
* Minting/Buying increases supply.
* Selling reduces supply.
  * Redeemed $TRT tokens are burned/destroyed and removed from circulation.

Price = $USDC in Treasury / Circulating Supply of $TRT
