# Fee Mechanics and Revenue Allocations

The primary revenue stream to start will be the fees generated from buying and selling. The TRT protocol has multiple treasuries, which will all be under multisig wallets for the safety of funds and to protect against any hacking exploits of a singular wallet through private key fishing attempts and the like.  Here is a list of treasuries and purposes (treasury multisig wallet addresses will be provided)

### **Backing Treasury: 0xContractAddressTBD**

* Backing of all $TRT in $USDC
* Price determined from the amount of $USDC in this treasury

### **Protocol Treasury: 0xTBD**

* TRT team funds
* Marketing funds
* Other Expenses
  * Dev Expenses, etc
* Protocol $TRT token investments

## **Fee allocations by percentage and destination Treasury/contract**

### **BUY/SELL/TRANSFER Fee (2%)**

* 10% to NFT Treasury
* 10% to Investment Treasury
  * As funds build up, they will be allocated to different investment strategies, and yield/profits will be distributed back.
* 80% Protocol Treasury&#x20;
