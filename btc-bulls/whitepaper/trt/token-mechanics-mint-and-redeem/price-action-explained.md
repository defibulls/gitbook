# Price Action Explained

The price of $TRT is simply the $USDC value of the backing treasury divided by the circulating supply. An easy way to understand how the price can go up both on sells, buys, and transfers are to think of the treasury as always having a net positive gain on each transaction. For a sell transaction, more tokens are burned than paid out for a net gain on treasury vs. supply.  For a buy, more $TRT is allocated to the treasury than tokens minted to circulation for a net gain.  The net gain comes from the fees adding more to the backing treasury than the amount minted/paid out.&#x20;

Here is a rudimentary example of how buying and selling effects the price of $TRT.&#x20;

## BUY Transaction (ALICE)

**Alice buys 1000 $USDC worth of $TRT Tokens with a 2% buying fee**

* **1000 $USDC is exchanged for (1000 - (1000 \* .02)) $TRT**
  * **Alice receives 980 $TRT**
  * **Treasury receives 1000 $USDC**

#### **Circulating Supply is 992 $TRT**

**Treasury 1000 $USDC**

**Token Price from Transaction is 1000 $USDC / 992 $TRT,  so 1 $TRT = 1.008 $USDC**





## BUY Transaction (BOB)

**Bob buys 1000 $USDC worth of $TRT Tokens with a 2% buying fee**

* **1000 $USDC is exchanged for (1000 - (1000 \* .02)) $TRT**
  * **Bob receives 980 $TRT**
  * **Treasury receives 1000 $USDC**

**Circulating Supply is 1976 $TRT**

**Treasury 2000 $USDC**

**Token Price from Transaction is 2000 $USDC / 1976 $TRT,  so 1 $TRT = 1.012 $USDC**

* **Total appreciation of 0.4% for all the holders**





## SELL Transaction (BOB)

**Bob sells 500 $TRT Tokens with a 2% selling fee**

* **500 $TRT is exchanged for USDC**
  * **The Protocol burns $500 TRT and removes them from circulation.**
  * **Bob receives 496 $USDC**

**Circulating Supply is 1482 $TRT**

**Treasury 1504 $USDC**

**Token Price from Transaction is 1504 $USDC / 1482 $TRT,  so 1 $TRT = 1.015 $USDC**

* **Total appreciation of 0.69% for all the holders**
