# TRT

### What is TRT?

The token's name is more than just "The Ranch Token." This token will be the backbone of the project and will offer immense value as the project and ecosystem grow.&#x20;

TRT stands for the "**Trust Reservior Token**," which is the exact meaning I want the token to stand for because of what it will do within web3 and on the blockchain in general. &#x20;
