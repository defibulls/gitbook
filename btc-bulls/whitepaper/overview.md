# LORE

In a land of myth and legend, there was a vast ranch in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by mountains and wild landscapes. One day, a group of magnificent bulls arrived at the ranch, each with its unique appearance and personality. They quickly bonded and formed a strong community, working together to make the ranch prosper.

However, not all bulls were equal. Some were more powerful and influential than others, earning the coveted title of Alpha Bulls. The Alpha Bulls were chosen through fierce battles in the gold mine, where the most courageous bulls fought for supremacy. The victors were awarded staffs made of a precious mineral found deep in the mine, which symbolized their strength and dominance over the ranch.

As the Alpha Bulls grew in power, they realized the importance of bullion, a precious resource that allowed them to unlock new abilities and earn more rewards. They decided to create a system where all bulls could earn bullion based on their NFT, but the Alpha Bulls would earn more based on their rank.

The most unique aspect of the ranch, however, was the bull battles. In these battles, two NFTs fought against each other, with the winner taking the bullion accrual of the losing NFTs and the losing NFT being burned. The winning NFT was now adorned with a bull battle cube on its NFT, signifying its triumph.

This deflationary mechanism made bullion even more valuable, as the NFTs that survived the battles became more scarce and sought-after. Even a lowly bull could fight its way to increase its power and dominance within the ecosystem.

As the years went by, the ranch became a thriving community of bulls, each with their own unique personalities and stories. The Alpha Bulls continued to govern the ranch, using their wisdom and strength to make it a better place for all. And the legend of the bull battles and the power of bullion continued to live on, inspiring new generations of bulls to strive for greatness.
