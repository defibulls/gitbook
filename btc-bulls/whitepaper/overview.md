# OVERVIEW

## 10,000 FT VIEW OF 5K TR Bulls

The TR Bulls are built around Bitcoin Mining. This project is a club and a MAAS (mining-as-a-service) hybrid model. The heart of the ecosystem is buying TR Bulls as a way of buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster and sharing mining rewards.&#x20;

A project built with:

* Real Utility&#x20;
* Real Yield
* Real Rewards

There is strength in numbers, and the TR Bulls will put this on full display as a community.&#x20;

## WHY START THE PROJECT?

This is a loaded question and one I have to give several answers to:

**Reason 1:**

The bear market is doing what it does best; purging scammers, rug pulls, and deceitful players.&#x20;

**Reason 2:**

The last year has been chaos and financial obliteration in the crypto space. The goal from the beginning stages of this project was to launch when we were close and/or at the bottom of the Bear Market concerning BTC. Likely, we haven't reached the bottom of the Bear market yet, as the BTC hash rate hasn't collapsed yet. BTC hash rate collapsing around Bitcoins bottom makes sense from a cause-and-effect point of view. Two key events are happening or have happened that are affecting this:

* Lots of BTC mining companies are struggling, and a few of the larger publicly-traded Mining Companies have or are in the process of filing for bankruptcy. (i.e., compute-north & core-scientific).&#x20;
* The profitability of BTC mining is causing the small players to close up shop as profits are dwindling.

**Reason 3:**&#x20;

The price of BTC could likely fall further in the early months of next year when consumers realize they took on too much debt over the holiday season and start selling their BTC and other tokens/coins to make up for it.&#x20;

**Reason 4:**

The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $3K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s, the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I have to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what 'enterprise' clients at mining facilities get; buying in bulk allows the 'big boys' to start with electricity prices at or below $.070 kWh. They have enough leverage to work out these better electricity rates when the world is seemingly raising electricity prices everywhere.&#x20;

The way the hosting works at large hosting facilities is that they will provide a monthly invoice for each miner they host that is calculated like this:&#x20;



3,105 watts x 24hr / 1000 = 74.52kWh                (Each S19 runs at about 3100-3200 watts)

74.52 kWh x 0.070$/kwh = $5.22                        (Cost of a single S19/day in electricity at low rate)

$5.22 x 30 days = $156.60/month                      (Cost of electricity per month per miner)



Knowing that the energy costs will be a critical factor in the project's success, we know that partnering with the right business will make a huge difference.&#x20;
