### What is DDGT?

The Digital Disc Golf Token.

### Why is this our native token for the BTC Bulls?

It's important to know where the project's founder comes from and the value of his connection to the game, and this approach to make DDGT the native token for BTC Bulls.&#x20;

Disc Golf is a game that's growing more popular year by year. I played and devoted my early adult life to this game as I toured around the world, playing tournament after tournament with one end goal, to be a World Champion!

The value the DDGT token brings to Disc Golf and the value I bring as the ambassador of this Token is critical. I know thousands upon thousands of players, hundreds upon hundreds of tournament directors, and key decision-makers in all phases of the game.

To give you a quick understanding of the value in the game of Disc Golf, Here's an excellent article about a friend of mine, Simon Lizotte, who now joins Paul McBeth and Ricky Wysocki as the multi-million dollar sponsorships deals.&#x20;

As I've stated before, my vision for starting this project was to bridge the gap between web2 and web3. The first place I want to start in this quest is the world of Disc Golf. The overall goal of DDGT will be more than just the native token for the BTC Bulls. It will be a separate project that supports Disc Golf tournaments worldwide in real life and the digital side of Disc Golf within the ever-growing world of Esports.&#x20;

Even though this is a separate project, it's very closely tied to me, and I will help bring the BTC Bulls closer to it in multiple ways.&#x20;

* Firstly, DDGT will start with NFTs, each costing $200 to begin its presale. All BTC Bull owners can buy these NFTs for $180 automatically.&#x20;
  * Each DDGT NFT allows you to purchase DDGT during its presale at $1 per DDGT token. The amount you are allowed to buy is determined on a multiplier scale. Once the public sale of DDGT goes live, Liquidity (USDC) is added to the contract and raises the price to $1.10,&#x20;
  * This gives every DDGT NFT holder access to a presale that guarantees a 10% increase when the DDGT Token goes live.&#x20;
* Every BTC Bull Owner gets one free DDGT NFT for every 10 BTC Bulls they mint.&#x20;
* Rarity AirDrops for the BTC Bulls with Frogs and Turtles will be paid in DDGT when the DDGT Token goes live at $1.10 per DDGT token.&#x20;



The DDGT Token is a perpetually appreciating asset 100% backed by USDC on the Polygon Blockchain. Once the DDGT token is live, it perpetually appreciates due to buying and selling fees when people use it. We are building an ecosystem around the token. It will be used in the real world and online as it will serve as the only token that can be used to enter tournaments and payout tournaments. Each Token is backed by 100% USDC and redeemed for USDC.&#x20;

While this token may start at $1.10, it won't stay there. Due to how the contract works for the DDGT Token, it can only go up in value. This token has no limit and could easily be worth $10 per Token in the coming years and not stop there. There is immense value and opportunity in getting into a Token like this early, and that's the opportunity I want to give every BTC Bull owner.&#x20;
