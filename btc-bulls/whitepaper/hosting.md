## PARTNERSHIPS

We are excited to partner with Compass Mining as we launch the project.&#x20;

Anyone can buy and host mining equipment at a mining facility or their own house if they are set up for it. If they chose to do that, they would be seen as a 'residential' buyer and be subject to fewer benefits. Residential buyers buy a miner or two but do not buy in bulk. Reputable mining companies want to sell to this class of buyers but don't cater to them as they do to their bigger clients.&#x20;

The "Strength in numbers" aspect of the project will be the foundational reason for our success. Collectively we move out of the 'residential' space and are seen as an 'enterprise' client. This is hugely important for the project for two key reasons.&#x20;

* Cheaper prices for miners&#x20;
* Cheaper prices for electricity&#x20;

First and foremost, we will see our 'Enterprise' customer relationship bear fruit immediately with the initial cost of miners and hosting rates. Secondly, Compass does a great job on the back end handling all the logistics, security, maintenance, system uptime SLAs (service level agreements), and automation.&#x20;

Another reason partnering with Compass Mining is a great idea, they provide us flexibility when we move into more bullish times. Any miners we buy now for greatly reduced prices can later be sold on their platform to other customers as 'turn key' solutions for a 2-4x gain if we want to sell them and move into newer equipment.&#x20;
