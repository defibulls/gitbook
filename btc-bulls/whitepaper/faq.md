10. **When are NFT holders rewarded?** Quarterly between the 1st and 5th of that given month. The only way you get rewarded is by owning the BTC Bull at this time. If you sell the NFT on a marketplace and it has a new owner, the new owner will be distributed monthly rewards.&#x20;
11. **How will NFT holders be paid?** Mined bitcoin is converted to wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and distributed to NFT holders on the contract. &#x20;
12. **What is the percentage of BTC distributed to NFT holders each Quarter?**&#x20;

    1/3 of all Bitcoin goes to buy new Miners for the BTC Bulls Community, and 2/3 gets sent back to the contract during the Bear Market. Once the market flips, we will move to a 100% payout distribution to allow all NFT holders to take advantage of the price action of BTC.  &#x20;
13. **Why not just send users Bitcoin and not Wrapped Bitcoin?** Bitcoin is not an ERC20 token and thus doesn't work with EVM smart contracts. The only way to bring Bitcoin into our project is to convert it to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an ERC20 token that can be used on Ethereum-based smart contracts.&#x20;
14. **Will you ever use BTC instead of Wrapped Bitcoin to pay out NFT holders?** Perhaps one day in the future. Currently, some plugins allow EVM smart contracts to work with Bitcoins' network, but from a security perspective, they are risky. Thus, we will not use them until higher adoption and more security emphasis on bridging between Ethereum and Bitcoins networks. We will look into the lightning network in Q4 of 2023 to see if it's a good time to switch from WBTC to BTC's lightning network.
15. **What is the value of WBTC?** The price of Wrapped Bitcoin is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin.&#x20;
16. **Can I sell my NFTs in the project?** You can sell your NFTs (The Ranch BTC Bulls) on OpenSea. When doing so, there is a 12.5% royalty fee. &#x20;
