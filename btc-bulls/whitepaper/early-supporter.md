# EARLY SUPPORTER

## **EARLY SUPPORTERS ON THE RANCH:**

The only way to obtain an early supporter rank (ES) is to be the original owner of BTC Bull on the project. These are people who minted directly from the project. If someone obtains their BTC Bull from OpenSea, they will own the NFT in which they purchased, and they will be given access to the WBTC mining rewards each month, but they will not be seen as nor given the rank of an early supporter.

#### Why does this matter?

With the BTC Bulls,  owners that are 'ES' of the project will be allowed to participate in the royalty rewards program. As time marches on, fewer and fewer addresses who minted the BTC Bulls from the contract will remain. Thus the royalty rewards will become a more valuable opportunity over time.

As the team continues to build out the ecosystem within The Ranch itself and other projects, such as Digital Disc Golf using DDGT. The only people who will get a whitelist, presale, and giveaway opportunity are those who minted a BTC Bull and gained their ES status. &#x20;
