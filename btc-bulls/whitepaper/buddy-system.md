## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE BUDDY SYSTEM**

The Buddy System is an opt-in program designed to help new members of The Ranch Ecosystem get started. It is not a multi-level marketing or referral program with tiers or pyramid structures. The program only has one level of affiliate rewards. Members receive rewards during the monthly reward distribution.

If you choose to participate in the Buddy System, you will receive a 2% share of your Buddy's investment rewards forever. To qualify for this benefit, your Buddy must be in an "active" state, meaning they must own a TR Bull at the time of the rewarding event.

It is not mandatory to have a Buddy, and not having one will not affect your rewards. During rewarding transactions, 2% of your rewards will be deducted whether or not you have a Buddy. If your Buddy is in an active state, the benefit will be paid to them. Otherwise, it will go to The Ranch Core Team.

Once you select a Buddy, you cannot change it. If 'Bob' sets 'Alice' as their buddy, 'Alice' will not be able to set 'Bob' as her Buddy later. This is because one should have brought the other into the project.

There are two options for adding the person who referred you to the Buddy System. Your Buddy can set it on the mint page during your minting transaction. Alternatively, you can enter the Buddy's address using the 'hamburger' icon in the top right corner.&#x20;
