# BUDDY SYSTEM

## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE BUDDY SYSTEM**

The Buddy System is an onboarding system for new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is completely voluntary, unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new NFTs during the monthly reward of WBTC to NFT holders.

* **2% of the minting transaction cost**.
* **2% of quarterly WBTC reward payouts FOREVER!**

A Buddy must be in an 'active' state to receive the benefit. Active means the Buddy of the referred person owns a TR Bull at the time of the event.&#x20;

* Do I have to have a Buddy? No
* Does not having a Buddy hurt me? No, anyone with a Buddy or without a Buddy will have 2% deducted during the rewarding transactions. If the Buddy is in an active state, it goes to the Buddy of the referred person; if not, it goes to The Ranch Core Team.
* Can I switch my Buddy multiple times? No, once a Buddy is selected, it is final.
* If 'Bob' sets 'Alice' as their buddy, 'Alice' will not be allowed to set 'Bob' as her Buddy later. This gets blocked by the contract, as one should have brought the other into the project.&#x20;

#### How do I add the person who referred me to the project as my Buddy?&#x20;

When you enter the TR Bulls, the buddy address for that community can be changed using the 'hamburger' icon in the top right. An all-zero address indicates a Buddy is not set yet on the account overview. Once a Buddy is set, it will update the address on the account overview.&#x20;

* This is a contract call, so you must confirm the transaction through Metamask.
