# BUDDY SYSTEM

## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE BUDDY SYSTEM**

The Buddy System is an onboarding system for new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is entirely voluntary, unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new NFTs during the monthly reward of WBTC to NFT holders.

* **2% of Investment Rewards of your Buddy's payout FOREVER!**

A Buddy must be in an 'active' state to receive the benefit. Active means the Buddy of the referred person owns a TR Bull at the time of the rewarding event.&#x20;

* Do I have to have a Buddy? No
* Does not having a Buddy hurt me? No, anyone with a Buddy or without a Buddy will have 2% deducted during the rewarding transactions. If the Buddy is in an active state, it goes to the Buddy of the referred person; if not, it goes to The Ranch Core Team.
* Can I switch my Buddy multiple times? No, once a Buddy is selected, it is final.
* If 'Bob' sets 'Alice' as their buddy, 'Alice' will not be allowed to set 'Bob' as her Buddy later. This gets blocked by the contract, as one should have brought the other into the project.&#x20;

#### How do I add the person who referred me to the project as my Buddy?&#x20;

There are two options for this:

* Your buddy can set it on the mint page during your first minting transaction.
* Secondly, you can enter the buddy address using the 'hamburger' icon in the top right. An all-zero address indicates a Buddy is not set yet on the account overview. Once a Buddy is set, it will update the address on the account overview.
