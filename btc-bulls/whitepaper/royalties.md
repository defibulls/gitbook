# ROYALTIES

## ROYALTY REWARDS

There will be a 10% royalty fee when selling TR Bulls on OpenSea. 2.5% gets paid to OpenSea as a fee, and the remaining 7.5% is split.&#x20;

* **25%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **75%** goes into our quarterly Royalty Rewards program through airdrops, giveaways, etc.&#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, this could serve as a cool approach to reward those who supported first and stayed around.
