# ROYALTIES

## ROYALTY REWARDS

When TR Bulls are sold on secondary marketplaces, a 10% royalty fee will be applied. Out of this 10%, 2.5% will be collected by the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 7.5% will be divided as follows: 25% will be allocated to The Ranch for project development and related expenses, while 75% will be distributed among Alpha TR Bull NFT owners. When distributing the royalty rewards to Alpha TR Bull owners, it will be done based on their Bullion weights. For instance, if $2000 of royalty revenue is dispersed among all Alpha TR Bulls, the following example can be used:&#x20;
