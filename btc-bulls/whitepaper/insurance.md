This project could start perfectly as we house millions of dollars of BTC Miners in Texas, and hopes are high all around. Murphy's law is bound to strike, and it's a fear that must be dealt with. A project like this without insurance is simply a dumb idea, for lack of a better term.&#x20;

The BTC Bulls miner cluster and assets will be under an insurance policy.
