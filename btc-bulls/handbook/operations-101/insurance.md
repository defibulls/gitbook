# INSURANCE

This project could start perfectly as we house millions of dollars of BTC Miners in Texas, and hopes are high all around. Murphy's law is bound to strike, and it's a fear that must be dealt with. A project like this without insurance is simply a dumb idea, for lack of a better term.&#x20;

This ties back into another perk of partnering with Compass Mining for this project. We would fall under their corporate insurance policy and cover the entire operation for 1.5% per year.&#x20;

If we purchased a high-end S19XP 141 TH/s miner for $5,000, it would cost us $75 per month for insurance. A portion of each month's mining rewards will go towards the insurance policy of the communities mining cluster. If the goal is to save $3500 per month for this annual policy, that money would be taken first from the monthly mining rewards before taking the rest back to the smart contract to distribute the remaining WBTC rewards to each NFT.&#x20;
