## 10,000 FT VIEW OF 10,000 BTC BULLS

The BTC Bulls community is built around Bitcoin Mining. This project combines a MAAS (mining-as-a-service) and a club. The heart of the ecosystem is buying a BTC Bull NFT, which means buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster and sharing mining rewards.  There is strength in numbers, and the BTC Bulls will put that on full display.&#x20;

## BITCOIN MINING

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One person can mine Bitcoin alone, but it doesn't stack up against what we can do as a community.&#x20;

Anyone can buy and host mining equipment at a mining facility or their own house if they are set up for it. If they chose to do that, they would be seen as a 'residential' buyer and be subject to fewer benefits. Residential buyers buy a miner or two but do not buy in bulk. Reputable mining companies want to sell to this class of buyers but don't cater to them as they do to their bigger clients.&#x20;

The "Strength in numbers" aspect of the project will be the foundational reason for our success. Collectively we move out of the 'Residential' space and are seen as an 'Enterprise' client. This is hugely important for the project for two key reasons.&#x20;

* Cheaper prices for miners&#x20;
* Cheaper prices for electricity&#x20;

We are excited to partner with Compass Mining to launch the project as they'll be the best fit to make us as profitable as we can be for multiple reasons.  First and foremost, we will see our 'Enterprise' customer relationship bear fruit immediately with the initial cost of miners and hosting rates. Secondly, Compass does a great job on the back end handling all the logistics, security, maintenance, system uptime SLAs (service level agreements), and automation.&#x20;

Another reason is that Compass gives us flexibility when we move out of this bear market. Any miners we buy now for extremely lower prices can later be sold on their platform to other customers as 'turn key' solutions for a 2-4x gain if we want to sell them and move into newer equipment.&#x20;

## TOTAL SUPPLY AND MINT COST:

The BTC Bulls Community is an NFT collection built on the Polygon Blockchain, with 10,000 BTC Bulls being released in 10 different tiers. Each tier must be bought out completely before the next tier opens. USDC.e is the token used for purchasing in all tiers.&#x20;

## TOKENS/COINS THAT WILL BE USED&#x20;

The Ranch BTC Bulls will not revolve around its own native token by design. The primary tokens this project will use include the following:

* BTC (BITCOIN)
  * BTC is used as the BTC mining reward token that is received for our mining efforts.&#x20;
* WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN)
  * WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and pay out thousands of NFTs within the project.&#x20;
* USDC.e&#x20;
  * Used to mint the NFTs and also the reward token used in our minting reward system, mint raffle drawings, and our other ecosystem animal NFTs that tie back to the BTC Bulls to reward the owners.&#x20;
* MATIC &#x20;
  * This is the native token of Polygon, and each user must have it to use for gas when interacting with the smart contract.&#x20;



## MINTING NFTS

When a user elects to enter the Minting raffle when minting BTC Bull NFTs, 3% of the transaction cost is held in the Minting Raffle Fund, and the user becomes eligible to win the raffle drawing when it reaches 100 entries. Opting into the raffle is a manual and voluntary process for the user themselves and only allows participation in that particular drawing.  If a user elects to mint 1 BTC Bull NFT or 10 BTC Bull NFTs and opts to enter the Daily Minting Raffle, they will be entered into the raffle one single time. A single winner shall receive the entire Daily Raffle amount, and then it is reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new BTC Bull NFTs are eligible to enter the Raffle, this doesn't matter if it's the first time a user has minted or the user has taken part in previous Minting Raffles.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 1</p></figcaption></figure>

When a user does not elect to enter the Minting Raffle, the 3% that would have gone to the Minting Raffle Fund is then passed to the BTC Miners Safe. The user will not be entered into the Minting Raffle during this transaction. Thus, they are not eligible to win it:&#x20;

## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Compounding Illustration.svg>) MONTHLY BTC MINING REWARDS



All BTC mining efforts will be processed monthly between the 1st and 5th of the month.&#x20;

**1/3** of all rewards received from the mining facility will be reinvested back into the mining cluster to purchase more BTC miners.&#x20;

**2/3** of the monthly reward received will be converted to WBTC and deposited into the BTC Bulls Smart Contract, with 10% going back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, and marketing. The remaining 90% is then dispersed to the owners of the BTC Bulls NFTs in pro-rata format. Using this approach, each NFT is awarded the exact same amount. An address owning 5 NFTs would get 5x more WBTC rewards than a person owning a single NFT.

## MAINTENANCE FEES



The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $3K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s, the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I personally have to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what we can expect with flare gas locations, where we can get our electric fees down to $.070&#x20;

But what about the MAINTENANCE FEES? What is this, and why is this important? Let's play out an example of how this project will go. We start the project and sell our BTC Bull NFTs and purchase miners. We go through the first three tiers and sell 2999 BTC Bulls. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle; 89% of the minting cost would go to buying miners for the project.&#x20;

* TIER 1 = (999 \* 350) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 2 = (1000 \* 360) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 3 = (1000 \* 370) \* 0.89&#x20;



BTC MINERS SAFE == ((999 \* 350) + (1000 \* 360) + (1000 \* 370 )) \* 0.89  ==  $960,888.50



The way the hosting works at the hosting facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner they host that is calculated like this:&#x20;

3,105watts x 24hr / 1000 = 74.52kWh

74.52kWh x 0.070$/kwh = $5.22

$5.22 x 30days = $156.60/month

The BTC MINERS SAFE is then used to purchase and start building the project's BTC MINER CLUSTER. Let's assume we can purchase 100 TH/s Antminer S19s for ≈$4000 each

$960,888.50 / $4000 == ≈ 240 Antminer S19 100Th/s&#x20;

When factoring in tax or other transaction expenses, the BTC MINER CLUSTER starts off with about 240 s19j Pro miners or about 24,000 TH/s of mining power.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES THE PROJECT PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

Each BTC Bull NFT on the project shares the hosting invoice. In the current example, 240 miners on the invoice would be ≈ $38,000 if we average a $156.60 hosting fee per miner. Since we have 2999 BTC Bulls in circulation, each BTC Bull NFT will share that invoice, and $12.53 will be the calculated monthly maintenance fee.

As the project continues to grow and we mint out Tier 6, there will be 6999 BTC Bulls in circulation; this changes the maintenance fees accordingly. For the sake of this example, we would purchase more miners to add to the BTC MINING CLUSTER, but that could take up to 30 days to come online. Now that 6999 BTC Bull NFTs exist, a larger invoice is shared amongst more BTC Bulls.&#x20;

The next month, we bring online 240 more miners, then we would be sharing a ≈$76,000 invoice amongst 6999 BTC bulls, putting each BTC Bull maintenance fee for the month at about ≈$10.85

Through compounding efforts, our BTC Miner Cluster has the potential to grow to a very large and powerful number. We can't predict what the future holds for us and thus have set a monthly maintenance fee cap for all BTC Bulls. Even if the calculated monthly maintenance fee exceeds $15, the max maintenance fee for each BTC Bull will be $15.

From all our projections, see [projections](projections.md), the last thing we want to do as a project is burn our mined Bitcoin to pay for hosting fees. However, there is a delicate line between burning Bitcoin for hosting fees and having reasonable and consistent maintenance fee expectations for all BTC Bull NFT holders. &#x20;

A hosting invoice of $185,000 being shared between all 10,000 BTC Bulls works out to be $18.50 per NFT. With the maintenance fees cap in place, each BTC Bull gets a $15 maintenance fee for the month.&#x20;

$185,000 - $150,000 == $30,000 left to cover&#x20;

In this instance, we would have to convert $30,000 of our mined BTC to pay for the hosting fees. The rest then gets dispersed as rewards for the month, according to FIG 3.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES A USER PAY THEIR MAINTENANCE FEES?

Each transaction will go through this logic process when paying monthly maintenance fees. If a user has enough USDC.e on the contract, the maintenance fee amount will be deducted from their USDC.e balance when paying the maintenance fees. Otherwise, each user will need to pay the maintenance fees from their own personal wallet using USDC.e

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 5</p></figcaption></figure>

#### HOSTING SAFE

As noted in the Minting figures (FIG 1 and FIG 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the HOSTING SAFE. This money is kept in the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet to pay for hosting fee invoices. Each month when users pay their maintenance fees, that money goes to replenish the HOSTING SAFE balance. &#x20;

A very important concept and design of the project revolves around the HOSTING SAFE and what would happen if the HOSTING SAFE were to run out of money. As every user must pay their maintenance fees before being allowed to withdraw their rewards, this should take care of itself. If we are still in a deficit, this problem will likely crop up if enough users are not paying their maintenance fees over time. If this scenario does play out, we will have to use a portion of our monthly mining rewards to cover the invoice. The Ranch has simple ground rules to comply with; pay your fees to help yourself and the community alike. There is **NO** plan to punish all holders of BTC Bulls if this were to happen. This is why there is a liquidation function in the contract.&#x20;

#### HOW IS THE LIQUIDATION FUNCTION USED?

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 6</p></figcaption></figure>

When monthly WBTC is deposited into the smart contract, the BTC Bull NFTs are rewarded in the pro-rata format. Variables and mappings are updated on the contract for each address that owns an NFT. The maintenance fees work like a clock and tick down each month during the 'reward' period. A 'reward' period happens between the 1st to 5th of each month. If a user lets their maintenance clock get to 0, that user gets checked for a possible liquidation event. In this project, liquidation means that the WBTC balance for that wallet address will be deducted from them and sent to the HOSTING SAFE. This is the WBTC that will be used to pay invoices in the absence of users paying maintenance fees. If this does happen to a user, their maintenance clock is reset back to three, and the total maintenance balance for that user is reset back to zero. That address also has a counter that keeps track of how many liquidations they have, which will be incremented by 1.&#x20;

The key difference between our liquidation structure and other projects, such as StrongBlock, is if a user gets behind and doesn't pay the maintenance fees. They wouldn't lose everything as you would have in StrongBlock. In our ecosystem, the user would forfeit the current WBTC in their account on our contract, and then they are reset back to good standing, ready to receive next month's WBTC awards. &#x20;

If a user's maintenance clock gets to zero, they are up for a possible liquidation event. We don't want to liquidate anyone and have made the contract work in a way that avoids this, if possible, by default. The contract will check If a user has more than three months of max maintenance fees, $45, in their USDC.e rewards balance. If that user does, we deduct the $45 from their USDC.e balance and send it to the HOSTING SAFE. That user then gets their maintenance clock reset back to three, and their maintenance fee balance resets to zero. This user will not be liquidated and thus wouldn't have their liquidation count incremented.  On the flip side of this, if that user doesn't have $45 in their USDC.e rewards balance, they would get liquidated.&#x20;

Within the project, we have built many ways a user can increase their USDC.e rewards on the contract and will continue to build more as time goes on. Referring people to the project gives you 2% of their minting transaction cost. The minting raffle increases any of the winner's USDC.e balance on the contract, and the Royalty Raffle will do the same. A user can also load USDC.e into their own rewards balance. This would allow a user always to have USDC.e in their account and avoid liquidation. As long as the user has $45 in their USDC.e balance, they can't get liquidated. Users can deposit up to $540 into their own USDC.e rewards, which would protect them from liquidation for ≈ three years.&#x20;



## HOW LONG DOES EACH MINER LAST, AND WHAT IS DONE WHEN THEY FAIL?

We are projecting each miner to be operational for 60 months. Some will last longer, and others will fail before that time. When designing the project, we had two options. (1) Take 100% of all the mining rewards and disperse those to the community, or (2) Take a percentage of the mining Rewards Monthly and continue buying more miners for the project. Had we gone with option 1, the BTC Bulls' revenue stream would die around 60 months. The goal of the project is to mine Bitcoin until the very end. Turning back a portion of the monthly profits to buy more miners is how we are going to do that. We are going to use 1/3 of all monthly rewards to purchase more miners. 2/3 of that monthly mined amount is then dispersed into the contract and distributed according to FIG 3.

#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MINERS DIE/FAIL?

When a miner fails, most likely, it will be a hashboard or power supply issue. If that is the case, the hosting staff will fix those miners on-site, and we will pay for fixes with the HOSTING SAFE. If it's truly the end of life for a miner because it's not worth repairing, it's a best-effort attempt to get the most money we can from selling them. All revenue generated from selling a miner is dispersed back into the project, according to FIG 3. Miners will inevitably die, and hundreds, if not thousands, of miners will die during this project. That's why we will constantly be buying more miners as we turn 1/3 of monthly rewards back into new purchase orders.&#x20;



## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Networking (1).svg>) BTC BULL CENTRALITY

Ownership of a BTC BULL is the central part of this project. Other assets will be deployed within the ecosystem, but all assets are tied back to the BTC Bulls. Future partnerships with other projects will have incentives for BTC Bull owners only. When we launch our native token of The Ranch, BTC Bull owners will be the only ones receiving them. &#x20;

Any and all Raffles require ownership of a BTC Bull.&#x20;

## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Raffle Drawing Machine.svg>) RAFFLE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png>)

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

#### MINTING RAFFLE

When minting new NFTs, users can voluntarily enter the Minting Raffle, where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the Raffle winner. Once 100 people enter the raffle, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund, which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC.e that is allowed to withdraw from the contract from that user.&#x20;

#### ROYALTY RAFFLE

There will be a 10% royalty fee when selling BTC Bulls on secondary marketplaces.  2.5% of that gets paid to the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 7.5% will be split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Raffle. Each month, this 50% will be divided equally and dispersed between up to 3 BTC Bulls. This amount will be uploaded into the USDC.e balance on the contract for those winning BTC Bulls owners. See the raffle explanation for a deeper explanation, further explanation [here](raffle-deep-dive.md). &#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and/or profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get anywhere close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, these raffle amounts have the potential to be special.



## ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS

There **WILL** be additional revenue opportunities within The Ranch.

* Will BTC Bull owners be able to vote on them? NO

This is one of the most important parts of The Ranch Ecosystem. There will be no voting for projects to see if the majority want to participate. As with all things, there will be good and bad investments along the way. The important part for us is that each additional idea that comes about will be 100% optional. These additional revenue streams will also come from other Animals that live within The Ranch.&#x20;

* One such project coming soon would be adding Kangaroos to The Ranch. These will be used to purchase Kadena Miners. For example, these Kangaroo NFTs could sell for $100

If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a great idea, then, by all means, take part in it and hopefully enjoy the upside from the investment. On the flip side of that, If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a foolish idea, then I stay away from them. All money going to purchase these Miners will stem from the sale of Kangaroo NFTs (TRKK). The success or failure of these TRKK NFTs will have no bearing on those who do not participate. That is the foundational reason no voting will be needed. If you like the idea, jump in. Think it's not for you, stay away.&#x20;



## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE BUDDY SYSTEM**

The Buddy System is an onboarding system for new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is completely voluntary. Unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new BTC Bull NFTs or during the monthly payout of WBTC to NFT holders. 2% of the minting transaction cost will be given to the Buddy of the referred person. During monthly payouts, 2% of the calculated reward is given to the Buddy of the referred person. 2% of the winning Royalty Raffle amount will go to the Buddy of the referred person. The person set as your partner must own a BTC Bull at that moment to be considered 'active' and receive the benefit.&#x20;

* Do I have to have a Buddy? No
* Does not having a Buddy benefit or hurt me? No, anyone with a Buddy or without a Buddy will have 2% deducted during the transactions. If the Buddy is in an active state, then it goes to the Buddy of the referred person; if not, it goes to The Ranch Core Team.
* Can I switch my Buddy multiple times? No, once a Buddy is selected, it is final. &#x20;
*   How do I set up my Buddy address? Once logged into the website, under the "GRANARY" tab, there is a 'BUDDY ADDRESS" section. Click the pencil icon and update the address with your desired partner. This is a transaction with the contract, so you will have to approve this through MetaMask.&#x20;



    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 7</p></figcaption></figure>

## OUR NATIVE TOKEN

Will we eventually have a native token? Yes

There currently isn't a timeline for this addition. However, when the time does arise, all BTC Bull owners will split and be airdropped a portion of the Total Supply.&#x20;

## PAUSING OF THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

#### WBTC DEPOSITS INTO THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

During the first couple days of each month, between the 1st to 5th day, 2/3 of the Bitcoin rewards will be withdrawn from the mining facility and converted to WBTC. When the WBTC is deposited into the contract and dispersed to BTC Bull owners, All WBTC withdraws will be paused during this short amount of time. While the contract updates every account during this process, it is important to ensure all accounts are static and not in the middle of any transactions.&#x20;

#### DURING THE MINTING RAFFLE

During the Minting Raffle, The minting function will pause and no longer allow any new mints for a few minutes. This is to allow the Minting Raffle function to work correctly without any data changing mid-process.  &#x20;
