## 10,000 FT VIEW OF 10,000 BTC BULLS

The BTC Bulls community is built around Bitcoin Mining. This project combines a MAAS (mining-as-a-service) and a club. The heart of the ecosystem is buying a BTC Bull NFT, which means buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster and sharing mining rewards.  There is strength in numbers, and the BTC Bulls will put that on full display.&#x20;

## BITCOIN MINING

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One person can mine Bitcoin alone, but it doesn't stack up against what we can do as a community.&#x20;

Anyone can buy and host mining equipment at a mining facility or their own house if they are set up for it. If they chose to do that, they would be seen as a 'residential' buyer and be subject to fewer benefits. Residential buyers buy a miner or two but do not buy in bulk. Reputable mining companies want to sell to this class of buyers but don't cater to them as they do to their bigger clients.&#x20;

The "Strength in numbers" aspect of the project will be the foundational reason for our success. Collectively we move out of the 'Residential' space and are seen as an 'Enterprise' client. This is hugely important for the project for two key reasons.&#x20;

* Cheaper prices for miners&#x20;
* Cheaper prices for electricity&#x20;

We are excited to partner with Compass Mining to launch the project as they'll be the best fit to make us as profitable as we can be for multiple reasons.  First and foremost, we will see our 'Enterprise' customer relationship bear fruit immediately with the initial cost of miners and hosting rates. Secondly, Compass does a great job on the back end handling all the logistics, security, maintenance, system uptime SLAs (service level agreements), and automation.&#x20;

Another reason is that Compass gives us flexibility when we move out of this bear market. Any miners we buy now for extremely lower prices can later be sold on their platform to other customers as 'turn key' solutions for a 2-4x gain if we want to sell them and move into newer equipment.&#x20;

## TOTAL SUPPLY AND MINT COST:

The BTC Bulls Community is an NFT collection built on the Polygon Blockchain, with 10,000 BTC Bulls being released in 10 different tiers. Each tier must be bought out completely before the next tier opens. USDC.e is the token used for purchasing in all tiers.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (3) (1).png" alt="Cost breakdown when buying BTC Bulls"><figcaption><p>FIG 0</p></figcaption></figure>



## TOKENS/COINS THAT WILL BE USED&#x20;

The Ranch BTC Bulls will not revolve around its own native token by design. The primary tokens this project will use include the following:

* BTC (BITCOIN)
  * BTC is used as the BTC mining reward token that is received for our mining efforts.&#x20;
* WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN)
  * WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and pay out thousands of NFTs within the project.&#x20;
* USDC.e&#x20;
  * Used to mint the NFTs and also the reward token used in our minting reward system, mint raffle drawings, and our other ecosystem animal NFTs that tie back to the BTC Bulls to reward the owners.&#x20;
* MATIC &#x20;
  * This is the native token of Polygon, and each user must have it to use for gas when interacting with the smart contract.&#x20;



## MINTING NFTS

When a user elects to enter the Minting raffle when minting BTC Bull NFTs, 3% of the transaction cost is held in the Minting Raffle Fund, and the user becomes eligible to win the raffle drawing when it reaches 100 entries. Opting into the raffle is a manual and voluntary process and only allows participation in that particular drawing. If a user elects to mint 1 BTC Bull NFT or 10 BTC Bull NFTs and opts to enter the Minting Raffle, they will be entered into the raffle once. A single winner shall receive the entire Minting Raffle balance, which is then reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new BTC Bull NFTs are eligible to enter the Raffle, this doesn't matter if it's the first time a user has minted or taken part in previous Minting Raffles.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 1</p></figcaption></figure>

When a user does not elect to enter the Minting Raffle, the 3% that would have gone to the Minting Raffle Fund is then passed to the BTC Miners Safe. The user will not be entered into the Minting Raffle during this transaction. Thus, they are not eligible to win it:&#x20;

## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Compounding Illustration.svg>) MONTHLY BTC MINING REWARDS



All BTC mining efforts will be processed monthly between the 1st and 5th of the month.&#x20;

**1/3** of all rewards received from the mining facility will be reinvested back into the mining cluster to purchase more BTC miners.&#x20;

**2/3** of the monthly reward received will be converted to WBTC and deposited into the BTC Bulls Smart Contract, with 10% going back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, and marketing. The remaining 90% is then dispersed to the owners of the BTC Bulls NFTs in pro-rata format. Using this approach, each NFT is awarded the same amount. An address owning 5 NFTs would get 5x more WBTC rewards than a wallet address owning a single NFT.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 3</p></figcaption></figure>

## HOSTING FEES

The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $3K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s, the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I have to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what we can expect with flare gas locations, where we can get our electric fees down to $.070&#x20;

But what about the MAINTENANCE FEES? What is this, and why is this important? Let's play out an example of how this project will go. We start the project and sell our BTC Bull NFTs, and purchase miners. We go through the first three tiers and sell 2999 BTC Bulls. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle; 89% of the minting cost would go to buying miners for the project.&#x20;

* TIER 1 = (999 \* 350) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 2 = (1000 \* 360) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 3 = (1000 \* 370) \* 0.89&#x20;



BTC MINERS SAFE == ((999 \* 350) + (1000 \* 360) + (1000 \* 370 )) \* 0.89  ==  $960,888.50



The way the hosting works at the hosting facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner they host that is calculated like this:&#x20;

3,105watts x 24hr / 1000 = 74.52kWh

74.52kWh x 0.070$/kwh = $5.22

$5.22 x 30days = $156.60/month

The BTC MINERS SAFE is then used to purchase and build the project's BTC MINER CLUSTER. Let's assume we can purchase 100 TH/s Antminer S19s for ≈$4000 each

$960,888.50 / $4000 == ≈ 240 Antminer S19 100Th/s&#x20;

When factoring in tax or other transaction expenses, the BTC MINER CLUSTER starts off with about 240 s19j Pro miners or about 24,000 TH/s of mining power.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES THE PROJECT PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

When BTC Bulls are minted from the contract, they work and live on the grounds of The Ranch.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Farm (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As an owner of a BTC Bull(s), you are leasing the fenced plot of land, a stockyard, for your Bulls to live. Some owners will have stockyards with 1 or 2 Bulls, while others will create much larger ones. There is no limit on how many BTC Bulls can be housed within a particular stockyard. Each BTC Bull within your designated plot carries a $15 hosting fee per month. The collection of individual stockyard hosting fees goes directly to pay for the actual hosting fees of the project.&#x20;

This approach allows each BTC Bull within The Ranch to share the hosting invoice evenly. In the above example, 240 miners on the invoice would be ≈ $38,000 if we average a $156.60 hosting fee per miner. Since we have 2999 BTC Bulls in circulation, each BTC Bull NFT will share that invoice, and we would be able to retain leftover  ≈ $7,000 within the HOSTING SAFE to pay on later hosting invoices.&#x20;

Through compounding efforts, our BTC Mining Cluster has the potential to grow to a very large and powerful number. The following month we could add more miners as more Tiers sell out and our compounding efforts start. This could give us an invoice of $185,000 shared between all 9960\* BTC Bulls. With the set hosting fees for each plot, once we collected the $15 from each BTC Bull, we would still be short of paying the monthly invoice.&#x20;

$185,000 - $149,400 == $30,600 left to cover&#x20;

In this instance, we would have to convert $30,600 of our mined BTC to pay the remainder of the invoice. The rest of that mined BTC gets dispersed as monthly rewards, according to FIG 3.&#x20;

From all our projections, see [projections](projections.md), the last thing we want to do as a project is burn our mined Bitcoin to pay for hosting invoices. However, there is a delicate line between burning Bitcoin for hosting fees and having reasonable and consistent maintenance fee expectations for all BTC Bull NFT holders. &#x20;

#### HOW DOES A USER PAY THEIR HOSTING FEES FOR THEIR STOCKYARD?

Each transaction will go through this logic process when paying monthly hosting fees. If a user has enough USDC.e within their hosting reserve balance on the contract, the maintenance fee amount will be deducted from that balance. Otherwise, each user will need to pay the hosting fees from their wallet using USDC.e&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 5</p></figcaption></figure>

#### HOSTING SAFE

As noted in the Minting figures (FIG 1 and 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the HOSTING SAFE. This money is kept in the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet to pay for hosting fee invoices. Each month when users pay their stockyard hosting fees, they replenish the HOSTING SAFE balance. &#x20;

A very important concept and design feature of the project revolves around HOSTING SAFE and ensuring we keep funds in there to keep the project healthy. Every plot owner must pay the hosting fee for any BTC Bulls on the property within their plot. Every plot/stockyard owner within The Ranch has a 'Survey Clock' on their account ranging from 0-3. This represents how many pay periods can go by before The Ranch surveys its plot. A plot survey happens whenever a plot owner's account gets to zero on their survey clock.  When the survey clock does expire or gets to zero, their account is checked during the monthly pay period.&#x20;

When a plot owner's stockyard is surveyed and checked, The Ranch is looking to redeem the hosting fees due from that plot owner.  This is a normal process within our ecosystem. Essentially what we are doing is checking to see if the plot owners hosting reserve balance can cover their hosting balance. If that is the case, we pay the hosting balance for that plot owner's account and automatically reset their hosting balance and survey clock. If the account hosting reserve balance can not cover the hosting balance, we are forced to settle up with the account in another way. We would take the WBTC in that owner's account and send it to the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet and then reset that account's hosting balances and survey clock. Essentially we are liquidating the WBTC from that user's account and will have to sell it to help pay for the project hosting fee invoices. That plots owners account also has a counter that keeps track of how many liquidations they have, which will be incremented by 1.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The key difference between our liquidation structure and other projects, such as StrongBlock, is if a user gets behind and doesn't pay their hosting fees. They wouldn't lose everything as you would have in StrongBlock. In our ecosystem, the user only forfeits the current WBTC in their account on our contract, and then they are reset back to good standing, ready to receive next month's WBTC rewards.&#x20;

Plot owners do have the option never to be checked or surveyed. The only time any account is surveyed is if their survey clock gets to zero. A user can pay bi-monthly and never let their survey clock touch zero, and thus they would never be checked using this logic flow.  This approach is a manual process and perfectly fine for users to do. We wanted more of an autopay feature for plot owners and thus created the survey clock to handle it. If users have enough in their hosting reserve balance, that account can go for a long time without being liquidated.  &#x20;

Within the project, we have built many ways a user can increase their USDC.e balances on the contract and will continue to build more as time goes on. Referring people to the project gives you 2% of their minting transaction cost. The minting raffle and the Royalty Raffle will do the same and can fund an account for a long time. Alternatively, a user can also load USDC.e into their hosting reserve balance to cover survey events.  This would allow a user always to have USDC.e in their account and avoid liquidation. As long as the user has more in their hosting reserver balance than in their hosting balance, they can't get liquidated. Users can deposit up to $1000 per transaction into their hosting reserve balance, protecting them from liquidation as far as the user wants to project it out into the future.&#x20;



## HOW LONG DOES EACH MINER LAST, AND WHAT IS DONE WHEN THEY FAIL?

We are projecting each miner to be operational for 60 months. Some will last longer, and others will fail before that time. When designing the project, we had two options. (1) Take 100% of all the mining rewards and disperse those to the community, or (2) Take a percentage of the mining Rewards Monthly and continue buying more miners for the project. Had we gone with option 1, the BTC Bulls' revenue stream would die around 60 months. The goal of the project is to mine Bitcoin until the very end. Turning back a portion of the monthly profits to buy more miners is how we are going to do that. We are going to use 1/3 of all monthly rewards to purchase more miners. 2/3 of that monthly mined amount is then dispersed into the contract and distributed according to FIG 3.

#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MINERS DIE/FAIL?

When a miner fails, most likely, it will be a hashboard or power supply issue. If that is the case, the hosting staff will fix those miners on-site, and we will pay for fixes with the HOSTING SAFE. If it's truly the end of life for a miner because it's not worth repairing, it's a best-effort attempt to get the most money we can from selling them. All revenue generated from selling a miner is dispersed back into the project, according to FIG 3. Miners will inevitably die, and hundreds, if not thousands, of miners will die during this project. That's why we will constantly be buying more miners as we turn 1/3 of monthly rewards back into new purchase orders.&#x20;



## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Networking (1).svg>) BTC BULL CENTRALITY

Ownership of a BTC BULL is the central part of this project. Other assets will be deployed within the ecosystem, but all assets are tied back to the BTC Bulls. Future partnerships with other projects will have incentives for BTC Bull owners only. When we launch our native token of The Ranch, BTC Bull owners will be the only ones receiving them. &#x20;

Any and all Raffles require ownership of a BTC Bull.&#x20;

## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Raffle Drawing Machine.svg>) RAFFLE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png>)

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

#### MINTING RAFFLE

When minting new NFTs, users can voluntarily enter the Minting Raffle, where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the Raffle winner. Once 100 people enter the raffle, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund, which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC.e that is allowed to withdraw from the contract from that user.&#x20;

#### ROYALTY RAFFLE

There will be a 10% royalty fee when selling BTC Bulls on secondary marketplaces.  2.5% of that gets paid to the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 7.5% will be split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Raffle. Each month, this 50% will be divided equally and dispersed between up to 3 BTC Bulls. This amount will be uploaded into the USDC.e balance on the contract for those winning BTC Bulls owners. See the raffle explanation for a deeper explanation, further explanation [here](royalty-raffle.md). &#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and/or profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get anywhere close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, these raffle amounts have the potential to be special.



## ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS

There **WILL** be additional revenue opportunities within The Ranch.

* Will BTC Bull owners be able to vote on them? NO

This is one of the most important parts of The Ranch Ecosystem. There will be no voting for projects to see if the majority want to participate. As with all things, there will be good and bad investments along the way. The important part for us is that each additional idea that comes about will be 100% optional. These additional revenue streams will also come from other Animals that live within The Ranch.&#x20;

* One such project coming soon would be adding Kangaroos to The Ranch. These will be used to purchase Kadena Miners. For example, these Kangaroo NFTs could sell for $100

If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a great idea, then, by all means, take part in it and hopefully enjoy the upside from the investment. On the flip side of that, If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a foolish idea, then I stay away from them. All money going to purchase these Miners will stem from the sale of Kangaroo NFTs (TRKK). The success or failure of these TRKK NFTs will have no bearing on those who do not participate. That is the foundational reason no voting will be needed. If you like the idea, jump in. Think it's not for you, stay away.&#x20;



## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE BUDDY SYSTEM**

The Buddy System is an onboarding system for new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is completely voluntary. Unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new BTC Bull NFTs or during the monthly payout of WBTC to NFT holders. 2% of the minting transaction cost will be given to the Buddy of the referred person. During monthly payouts, 2% of the calculated reward is given to the Buddy of the referred person. 2% of the winning Royalty Raffle amount will go to the Buddy of the referred person. The person set as your partner must own a BTC Bull at that moment to be considered 'active' and receive the benefit.&#x20;

* Do I have to have a Buddy? No
* Does not having a Buddy benefit or hurt me? No, anyone with a Buddy or without a Buddy will have 2% deducted during the transactions. If the Buddy is in an active state, then it goes to the Buddy of the referred person; if not, it goes to The Ranch Core Team.
* Can I switch my Buddy multiple times? No, once a Buddy is selected, it is final. &#x20;
*   How do I set up my Buddy address? Once logged into the website, under the "GRANARY" tab, there is a 'BUDDY ADDRESS" section. Click the pencil icon and update the address with your desired partner. This is a transaction with the contract, so you will have to approve this through MetaMask.&#x20;



    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (5).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 7</p></figcaption></figure>

## OUR NATIVE TOKEN

Will we eventually have a native token? Yes

There currently isn't a timeline for this addition. However, when the time does arise, all BTC Bull owners will split and be airdropped a portion of the Total Supply.&#x20;

## PAUSING OF THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

#### WBTC DEPOSITS INTO THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

During the first couple days of each month, between the 1st to 5th day, 2/3 of the Bitcoin rewards will be withdrawn from the mining facility and converted to WBTC. When the WBTC is deposited into the contract and dispersed to BTC Bull owners, All WBTC withdraws will be paused during this short amount of time. While the contract updates every account during this process, it is important to ensure all accounts are static and not in the middle of any transactions.&#x20;

#### DURING THE MINTING RAFFLE

During the Minting Raffle, The minting function will pause and no longer allow any new mints for a few minutes. This is to allow the Minting Raffle function to work correctly without any data changing mid-process.  &#x20;
