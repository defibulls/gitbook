# SUPERBULLS VOTE SYSTEM

Once a proposal has gone thru using the interest system, it will move onto the second phase, a 'SUPER-BULLS VOTE.'

All **SUPER-BULLS** have access to the # 3ï¸±rancher-votes channel (link in discord), where all proposals that passed the proposal phase will be voted on.

Think of the **SUPER-BULLS** as a pseudo "Board of Directors," and the 'SUPER-BULLS VOTE' will serve as another vetting process of the proposal.

The Core Team still makes final decisions on all proposals; Knowing the direction the community wants to take is a key objective of the voting system.&#x20;
