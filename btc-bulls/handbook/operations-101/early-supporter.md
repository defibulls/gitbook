# EARLY SUPPORTER

## **EARLY SUPPORTERS ON THE RANCH:**

The only way to obtain an early supporter rank (ES) is to be the original owner of BTC Bull on the project. These are people who minted directly from the project once it was launched. If someone obtains their BTC Bull from OpenSea, they will own the NFT in which they purchased, and they will be given access to the WBTC mining rewards each month, but they will not be seen as nor given the rank of an early supporter.

#### Why does this matter?

With the BTC Bulls,  owners that are 'ES' of the project will be allowed to participate in the royalty rewards program. As time marches on, fewer and fewer addresses who minted the BTC Bulls from the contract will remain. Thus the royalty rewards will become a more valuable opportunity over time.
