# PROJECTIONS

## BITCOIN MINING&#x20;

1. BTC Mining is the central part of The Ranch. Starting the project in or near the bottom of the bear market is an advantage that can't be overlooked.  The ability for the team to buy miners for a fraction of the price and lock in better hosting rates will pay dividends down the road that wouldn't have been seen otherwise.
2. The other part of the project that needs to be stressed is the net profit we will see. A foundational decision for the project was **NOT** to convert our mined Bitcoin to pay for hosting fees. Spending a few bucks in USDC.e every month to cover the hosting fees (this is what our maintenance fees cover) will prove to be the differentiating factor that sets this project apart from other BTC mining projects. This helps us retain as much BTC as possible and increases the amount of BTC we can disperse back to NFT holders. &#x20;
3. All mined BTC goes back to the project and gets dispersed, according to [FIG 3](operations-101/#monthly-btc-mining-rewards). We are **NOT** taking a portion out of the monthly revenue to invest in alt-coins or other investments. There will be opportunities within our ecosystem for alt-coin mining, alt-coins, and external promising projects, but they will be optional to partake in (see [additional revenue streams](operations-101/#additional-revenue-streams)). This allows us to retain as much BTC as possible and, more importantly, disperse as much BTC/WBTC back to each NFT holder.&#x20;
4. BTC/WBTC will be dispersed back to NFT holders following the first month of operation. We will not withhold paying out NFT holders for months while we compound our mining efforts. We have built in the 1/3 reinvestment/compound strategy for this exact reason.&#x20;

## Yearly Projections:&#x20;

From a mathematical perspective, Bitcoin's difficulty and halving projections are critical to consider when designing how the project will work. Projects turning back mined BTC to pay for today's hosting fees is going to prove to be the biggest mistake of their projects.  Today Bitcoin is the same Bitcoin we will hold in 10 years, and we can get way more of it today for the same effort.&#x20;

For this projection, I have built a project calculator that looks to run the project as depicted in FIG 10 above. I am running this over a 10-year period and comparing what our treasury would look like if we did no maintenance fees and paid all hosting fees with our mined BTC vs. what it would look like if we use a $15 max maintenance fee approach. The key data here is in the BTC\_all\_time column, representing how much BTC we have received from our mining efforts as time marches on.&#x20;

#### NO MAINTENANCE FEES&#x20;

Notice that we only total 179.220 BTC mined over 120 months. Also, notice that we receive more BTC in the earlier months of the projection than we do towards the end. &#x20;



#### $15 MAX MAINTENANCE FEE

With the addition of our $15 max maintenance fee, we jump to 486.29, an improvement of 307 Bitcoins. These are merely projections within my scripts.&#x20;

I have run these hundreds of times through all sorts of scenarios that test different prices of BTC, the price of BTC miners, and the amount of BTC we will receive for each TH/s of mining effort. The overarching finding shows a massive benefit in protecting the early BTC we mine in this bear market with our money from maintenance fees vs. burning our bitcoin to pay the hosting fees. &#x20;
