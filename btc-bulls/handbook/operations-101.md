## 10,000 FT VIEW OF 10,000 BTC BULLS

The BTC Bulls community is built around Bitcoin Mining. This project combines a MAAS (mining-as-a-service) and a club. The heart of the ecosystem is buying a BTC Bull NFT, which is means of buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster and sharing mining rewards. The BTC Bulls will serve as the central focus of The Ranch ecosystem as the project evolves.&#x20;

## BITCOIN MINING

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 0</p></figcaption></figure>

Bitcoin Mining that benefits the environment and increases profitability?&#x20;

How can we mine Bitcoin, help the environment, and be as profitable as we can? Flare Gas!&#x20;

Mining Bitcoin using flare gas is hugely beneficial for all involved:&#x20;

* The Ranch gets the cheapest electric rates possible. Lower than hydro and on-grid sources. &#x20;
* Consuming flare gas in a generator to mine Bitcoin is a cleaner process than simply letting it burn in the air.&#x20;

Still, have questions?&#x20;

* &#x20;What is flare gas?&#x20;
* Why is there flare gas?
* How does this work?&#x20;

The video link below from SPACE DESIGN WAREHOUSE explains it much better than the text and gives you an introduction to who we will be hosting with. The Ranch is partnering with 'Musk Miners' to host all of our Bitcoin Miners in various flare gas locations.  &#x20;

## TOTAL SUPPLY AND MINT COST:

The BTC Bulls Community is an NFT collection built on the Polygon Blockchain, with 10,000 BTC Bulls being released in 10 different tiers. Each tier must be bought out completely before the next tier opens. USDC.e is the token used for purchasing in all tiers.&#x20;

## TOKENS/COINS THAT WILL BE USED&#x20;

The Ranch BTC Bulls will not revolve around its own native token by design. The primary tokens this project will use include the following:

* BTC (BITCOIN)
  * BTC is used as the BTC mining reward token that is received for our mining efforts.&#x20;
* WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN)
  * WBTC standardizes BITCOIN to the ERC20 format. This allows us to convert BTC to WBTC,  backed 1:1, and pay out thousands of NFTs within the project.&#x20;
* USDC.e&#x20;
  * Used to mint the NFTs and also the reward token used in our minting reward system, mint raffle drawings, and our other ecosystem animal NFTs that tie back to the BTC Bulls to reward the owners.&#x20;
* MATIC &#x20;
  * This is the native token of Polygon, and each user must have it to use for gas when interacting with the smart contract.&#x20;



## MINTING NFTS

When a user elects to enter the Minting raffle when minting BTC Bull NFTs, 3% of the transaction cost is held in the Minting Raffle Fund, and the user becomes eligible to win the raffle drawing when it reaches 100 entries. Opting into the raffle is a manual and voluntary process for the user themselves and only allows participation in that particular drawing.  If a user elects to mint 1 BTC Bull NFT or 10 BTC Bull NFTs and opts to enter the Daily Minting Raffle, they will be entered into the raffle one single time. A single winner shall receive the entire Daily Raffle amount, and then it is reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new BTC Bull NFTs are eligible to enter the Raffle, this doesn't matter if it's the first time a user has minted or the user has taken part in previous Minting Raffles.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 1</p></figcaption></figure>

When a user does not elect to enter the Minting Raffle, the 3% that would have gone to the Minting Raffle Fund is then passed to the BTC Miners Safe. The user will not be entered into the Minting Raffle during this transaction. Thus, they are not eligible to win it:&#x20;

## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Compounding Illustration.svg>) MONTHLY BTC MINING REWARDS



All BTC mining efforts will be processed monthly between the 1st and 5th of the month.&#x20;

**1/3** of all rewards received from the mining facility will be reinvested back into the mining cluster to purchase more BTC miners.&#x20;

**2/3** of the monthly reward received will be converted to WBTC and deposited into the BTC Bulls Smart Contract, with 10% going back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, and marketing. The remaining 90% is then dispersed to the owners of the BTC Bulls NFTs in pro-rata format. Using this approach, each NFT is awarded the exact same amount. An address owning 5 NFTs would get 5x more WBTC rewards than a person owning a single NFT.

## MAINTENANCE FEES



The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $3K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. Buying and hosting at the right facilities is crucial to this project, and that is why we are excited to work with Musk Miners. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s, the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I personally have to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what we can expect with flare gas locations, where we can get our electric fees down to $.059, if not lower, when we factor in the buying power we possess as a project.&#x20;

But what about the MAINTENANCE FEES? What is this, and why is this important? Let's play out an example of how this project will go. We start selling the project the BTC Bull NFTs and purchase miners from the onset. We go through the first three tiers and sell 2999 BTC Bulls. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle; 89% of the minting cost would go to buying miners for the project.&#x20;

* TIER 1 = (999 \* 350) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 2 = (1000 \* 360) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 3 = (1000 \* 370) \* 0.89&#x20;



BTC\_MINER\_FUND == ((999 \* 350) + (1000 \* 360) + (1000 \* 370 )) \* 0.89  ==  $960,888.50



The way the hosting works at the hosting facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner they host that is calculated like this:&#x20;

3,105watts x 24hr / 1000 = 74.52kWh

74.52kWh x 0.070$/kwh = $5.22

$5.22 x 30days = $156.60/month

Why so expensive? Firstly the cost of electricity, it would cost nearly double this price to run at your house.  Secondly, they provide 24/7 security and optimal conditions for each miner. &#x20;



The BTC\_MINER\_FUND is then used to purchase and start building the project's BTC MINER CLUSTER. Let's assume we can purchase 100 TH/s Antminer S19s for \~ $4000 each

$960,888.50 / $4000 == \~240 Antminer S19 100Th/s&#x20;

When factoring in tax or other transaction expenses, the BTC MINER CLUSTER starts off with about 240 s19j Pro miners or about 24,000 TH/s of mining power.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES THE PROJECT PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

Each BTC Bull NFT on the project shares the hosting invoice. In the current example, 240 miners on the invoice would be \~ $38,000 if we average a $156.60 hosting fee per miner. Since we have 2999 BTC Bulls in circulation, each BTC Bull NFT will share that invoice, and $12.53 will be the calculated monthly maintenance fee.

As the project continues to grow and we mint out Tier 6, there will be 6999 BTC Bulls in circulation; this changes the maintenance fees accordingly. For the sake of this example, we would purchase more miners to add to the BTC MINING CLUSTER, but that could take up to 30 days to come online. Now that 6999 BTC Bull NFTs exist, a larger invoice is shared amongst more BTC Bulls.&#x20;

The next month, we bring online 240 more miners, then we would be sharing a \~$76,000 invoice amongst 6999 BTC bulls, putting each BTC Bull maintenance fee for the month at about \~$10.85

Through compounding efforts, our BTC Miner Cluster has the potential to grow to a very large and powerful number. We can't predict what the future holds for us and thus have set a monthly maintenance fee cap for all BTC Bulls. Even if the calculated monthly maintenance fee exceeds $15, the max maintenance fee for each BTC Bull will be $15.

From all our projections, see [projections](projections.md), the last thing we want to do as a project is burn our mined Bitcoin to pay for hosting fees. However, there is a delicate line between burning bitcoin for hosting fees and having reasonable and consistent maintenance fee expectations for all BTC Bull NFT holders. &#x20;

A hosting invoice of $185,000 being shared between all 10,000 BTC Bulls works out to be $18.50 per NFT. With the maintenance fees cap in place, each BTC Bull gets a $15 maintenance fee for the month.&#x20;

$185,000 - $150,000 == $30,000 left to cover&#x20;

In this instance, we would have to convert $30,000 of our mined BTC into USDT and pay for the hosting fees. The rest then gets dispersed as rewards for the month, according to FIG 3.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES A USER PAY THEIR MAINTENANCE FEES?

Each transaction will go through this logic process when paying monthly maintenance fees. If a user has enough USDC.e on the contract, the maintenance fee amount will be deducted from their USDC.e balance when paying the maintenance fees. Otherwise, each user will need to pay the maintenance fees from their own personal wallet using USDC.e

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 5</p></figcaption></figure>

## HOSTING SAFE

As noted in the Minting figures (FIG 1 and FIG 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the HOSTING SAFE. This money is kept in the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet to pay for hosting fee invoices. Each month when users pay their maintenance fees, that money goes to replenish the HOSTING SAFE balance. &#x20;

A very important concept and design of the project revolves around the HOSTING SAFE and what would happen if the HOSTING SAFE were to run out of money. As every user is required to pay their maintenance fees before being allowed to withdraw their rewards, this should take care of itself. If we are still in a deficit, this problem will likely crop up if enough users are not paying their maintenance fees over time. If this scenario does play out, we will have to use a portion of our monthly mining rewards to cover the invoice. The Ranch has simple ground rules to comply with; pay your fees to help yourself and the community alike. There is **NO** plan to punish all holders of BTC Bulls if this were to happen. This is why there is a liquidation function in the contract.&#x20;

#### HOW IS THE LIQUIDATION FUNCTION USED?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 6</p></figcaption></figure>

When funds are deposited into the smart contract and BTC BULL NFTs are rewarded in the pro-rata format, variables and mappings are updated on the contract. If a user is 4 months behind on paying monthly maintenance fees, that user will get liquidated. In this project, that means that the WBTC contract balance for that user will be deducted from them and sent to the HOSTING SAFE. This is the WBTC that will be used to pay invoices in the absence of users paying maintenance fees. If this does happen to a user, the maintenance\_fee\_standing and total\_maintenance\_fees\_due variables are reset back to zero. The next month will be as if that user has started fresh on the contract.

* The key difference between our liquidation structure and other projects, such as StrongBlock, is if a user gets behind and simply doesn't pay the maintenance fees. They wouldn't lose everything as you would have in StrongBlock. In our ecosystem, the user would simply forfeit the current WBTC in their account on our contract, and then they are reset back to good standing, ready to redeem themselves.&#x20;



## HOW LONG DOES EACH MINER LAST, AND WHAT IS DONE WHEN THEY FAIL?

We are projecting each miner to be operational for 60 months. Some will last longer, and others will fail before that time. When designing the project, we had two options. (1) Take 100% of all the mining rewards and disperse those to the community, or (2) Take a percentage of the mining Rewards Monthly and continue buying more miners for the project. Had we gone with option 1, the BTC Bulls' revenue stream would die around 60 months. The goal of the project is to mine Bitcoin until the very end. Turning back a portion of the monthly profits to buy more miners is how we are going to do that. We are going to use 1/3 of all monthly rewards to purchase more miners. 2/3 of that monthly mined amount is then dispersed into the contract and distributed according to FIG 3.

#### WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MINERS DIE/FAIL?

When a miner fails, most likely, it will be a hashboard or power supply issue. If that is the case, the hosting staff will fix those miners on-site, and we will pay for fixes with the HOSTING SAFE. If it's truly the end of life for a miner because it's not worth repairing, it's a best-effort attempt to get the most money we can from selling them. All revenue generated from selling a miner is dispersed back into the project, according to FIG 3. Miners will inevitably die, and hundreds, if not thousands, of miners will die during this project. That's why we will constantly be buying more miners as we turn 1/3 of monthly rewards back into new purchase orders.&#x20;



## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Networking (1).svg>) BTC BULL CENTRALITY

Ownership of a BTC BULL is the central part of this project. Other assets will be deployed within the ecosystem, but all assets are tied back to the BTC Bulls. Future partnerships with other projects will have incentives for BTC Bull owners only. When we launch our native token of The Ranch, BTC Bull owners will be the only ones receiving them. &#x20;

All Royalty Raffles only include those who own a BTC Bull.&#x20;

## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Raffle Drawing Machine.svg>) RAFFLE

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (2).png>)

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

#### MINTING RAFFLE

When minting new NFTs, users can voluntarily enter the Minting Raffle, where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the Raffle winner. Once 100 people enter the raffle, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund, which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC.e that is allowed to withdraw from the contract from that user.&#x20;

#### ROYALTY RAFFLE

There will be a 10% royalty on the sale when selling BTC Bulls on secondary marketplaces.  2.5% of that gets paid to the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 7.5% will be split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Raffle. Each month, this 50% will be divided equally and dispersed to 3 BTC Bulls. This amount will be uploaded into the USDC.e balance on the contract for those 3 BTC Bulls owners.&#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and/or profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get anywhere close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, these raffle amounts have the potential to be special.



## ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS

There **WILL** be additional revenue opportunities within The Ranch.

* Will BTC Bull owners be able to vote on them? NO

This is one of the most important parts of The Ranch Ecosystem. There will be no voting for projects to see if the majority want to participate. As with all things, there will be good and bad investments along the way. The important part for us is that each additional idea that comes about will be 100% optional. These additional revenue streams will also come from other Animals that live within The Ranch.&#x20;

* One such project coming soon would be adding Kangaroos to The Ranch. These will be used to purchase Kadena Miners. For example, these Kangaroo NFTs could sell for $100

If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a great idea, then, by all means, take part in it and hopefully enjoy the upside from our investment.&#x20;

If an owner of a BTC Bull thinks this is a foolish idea, then stay away from them. All money going to purchase these Miners will stem from the sale of Kangaroo NFTs (TRKK). The success or failure of these NFTs will have no bearing on those who do not participate. That is the foundational reason no voting will be needed. If you like the idea, jump in. Think it's not for you, stay away.&#x20;



## ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Buddy System.svg>) **THE PARTNER-NETWORK**

The Partner-Network is an onboarding system for new participants in The Ranch Ecosystem. Participation is completely voluntary. Unlike other multi-level marketing and scam-type referral systems, which consist of pyramid structures, tiered referral trees, etc. There is only 1 level of affiliate rewards within The Ranch Ecosystem. Rewards are issued whenever the referred individual mints new BTC Bull NFTs or during the monthly payout of WBTC to NFT holders. 2% of the minting transaction cost will be given to the partner of the referred person. During monthly payouts, 2% of the calculated reward is given to the partner of the referred person. The person set as your partner must own a BTC Bull at that moment to be considered 'active' and receive the benefit.&#x20;

* Do I have to have a partner? No
* Does not having a partner benefit or hurt me? No, anyone with a partner or without a partner will have 2% deducted during the above transactions. If the partner is in an active state, then it goes to the partner of the referred person; if not, it goes to The Ranch Core Team.
* Can I switch my partner multiple times? No, once a partner is selected, it is final. &#x20;
*   How do I set a partner? Once logged into the website, under the "GRANARY" tab, there is a 'BUDDY ADDRESS" section. Click the pencil icon and update the address with your desired partner. This is a transaction with the contract, so you will have to approve this through MetaMask.&#x20;



    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## OUR NATIVE TOKEN

Will we eventually have a native token? Yes

There currently isn't a timeline for this addition. However, when the time does arise, all BTC Bull owners will split and be airdropped a portion of the Total Supply.&#x20;

## PAUSING OF THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

#### WBTC DEPOSITS INTO THE CONTRACT:&#x20;

During the first couple days of each month, between the 1st to 5th day, 2/3 of the Bitcoin rewards will be withdrawn from the mining facility and converted to WBTC. When the WBTC is deposited into the contract and dispersed to BTC Bull owners, All WBTC withdraws will be paused during this short amount of time. While the contract updates every account during this process, it is important to ensure all accounts are static and not in the middle of any transactions.&#x20;

#### DURING THE MINTING RAFFLE

During the Minting Raffle, The minting function will pause and no longer allow any new mints for a few minutes. This is to allow the Minting Raffle function to work correctly without any data changing mid-process.  &#x20;
