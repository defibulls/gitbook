# VISION

## The Ranch:&#x20;

#### First and Foremost, if this project doesn't provide value to the participants, then this project is an absolute failure on my part.&#x20;

#### Transparency; As a community member, events, contracts, and decisions will be transparent to anyone and everyone who cares to know. If you want to know where each dollar goes within the project, it's there for viewing. Events are set up for nearly all critical functions within the contracts, and we want to handle everything on the blockchain. &#x20;

## BTC Bulls and BTC Bears:&#x20;

#### Mine bitcoin as a group as we fractionalize the buy-in process, pooling our resources together, allowing all of us to take part in premium equipment bundle packages previously reserved for only the wealthier individuals and businesses to take part in. The BTC Bulls and BTC Bears plan to be around until at least 2040, when Bitcoin is no longer mineable. Since Bitcoin is deflationary, there will never be more than 21,000,000 tokens in existence, and retaining as much as we can for each Bull and Bear is the goal.&#x20;
