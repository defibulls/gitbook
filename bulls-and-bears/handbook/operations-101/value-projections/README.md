# VALUE PROJECTIONS

First and foremost, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. It's simply how the data works out in the projection model when comparing different hosting fees against the same dataset to see which approach is better.&#x20;

The important thing to consider is that this is simply a projection of the value each NFT would earn in the first seven years of the project. The X-Axis is what BTC 'could' be worth in the future for comparison.&#x20;

Regardless of the price I project for BTC and the price of Miners I project when re-investing in them, the truth is that we will earn more BTC mining today than we will in the coming years. That's why the hosting fees matter as much as they do. &#x20;



When looking at the amount each NFT would have to pay for hosting fees over the same period, the raw numbers come out like this.&#x20;

* month = represents the current month in the simulation&#x20;
* hosting\_fees = that's how much each NFT paid in hosting fees for that given month.
* hosting\_fees\_total =  an aggregate of how much the hosting fees for that NFT have been over the project's life.&#x20;
* BTC\_earned = how much that NFT received the BTC for the given month.&#x20;
* BTC\_earned\_Total = an aggregate of how much the NFT has earned in BTC over the project's life.&#x20;
