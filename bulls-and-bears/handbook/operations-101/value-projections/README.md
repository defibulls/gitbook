# VALUE PROJECTIONS

First and foremost, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. It's simply how the data works out in the projection model when comparing different hosting fees against the same dataset to see which approach is better.&#x20;

The important thing to consider is that this is simply a projection of the value each NFT would earn in the first seven years of the project. The X-Axis is what BTC 'could' be worth in the future for comparison.&#x20;

Regardless of the price I project for BTC and the price of Miners I project when re-investing in them, the truth is that we will earn more BTC mining today than we will in the coming years. That's why the hosting fees matter as much as they do. &#x20;



## Project simulation against Data Set:&#x20;

If we look at our hosting fees, the approach for the BTC Bulls by only changing the hosting cost between $0,$5, and $15 for the max hosting fee per NFT for the month. You can see the difference it makes when we don't have to burn BTC, in the beginning, being in a down market. In the simulation, I am projecting the price of BTC, the mining payout each miner will get per day, and the cost of buying a new miner. This simulation uses a static price of $350 per NFT and assumes we mint out all 10,000 BTC Bulls.

These projections below show the amount of BTC we get to take back to the smart contract to distribute 90% of the "BTC remaining after" amount to each NFT.&#x20;
