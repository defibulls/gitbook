# HOSTING FOR BTC Bulls

## HOSTING FEES FOR THE BTC Bulls

While there will be hosting fees associated with the project, there will not be any hosting fees attached to the NFTs. We plan for the BTC Bulls community to purchase the most efficient miners we can S19XP 134-141's to increase our efficiency in terms of hashrate and electricity costs. &#x20;

Each month we will be issued an invoice for hosting our BTC miners at Compass Mining. As a project, we will have to use our BTC rewards to pay for these hosting fees and the remainder of the rewards left represents the amount that comes back to the project and/or reinvested depending on the ratio we use.&#x20;
