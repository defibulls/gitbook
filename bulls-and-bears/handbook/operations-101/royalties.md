# ROYALTIES

## ROYALTY REWARDS

There will be a 12.5% royalty fee when selling BTC Bulls on OpenSea.  2.5% gets paid to OpenSea as a fee, and the remaining 10% is split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Rewards.

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, this could serve as a cool approach to reward those who supported first and stayed around.

### THE COMMUNITY WILL DECIDE!&#x20;

Once the project is officially alive and rolling, royalties on the sale of NFTs on OpenSea will be generated. From a legal perspective, the team doesn't want to introduce any physical actions that the long-standing members of the community must do to allow them to participate in a giveaway and then have to let AMOE entries into it as well. We will all the community to vote on how to best approach this.&#x20;

1. The initial idea is to create a game for The Ranch that allows eligible users to compete for slots to win $590. This doesn't have to be an elaborate game, as 'flappy bird' would have served this purpose very well.&#x20;
2. Distribute the Royalty rewards in a pro-rata format to all eligible NFT owners.&#x20;

No decision has been made on this; the community will decide. The part we do know about this whole idea is the criteria each wallet address (account) needs to meet to be eligible to participate in either idea that comes to life is:

* The wallet address owns a BTC Bull.&#x20;
* The wallet address used must be an 'early supporter' of the project, thus, must have minted a BTC Bull directly from the project during the minting phase.&#x20;
