# INSURANCE

This project could start perfectly as we house millions of dollars of BTC Miners in Texas, and hopes are high all around. Murphy's law is bound to strike, and it's a fear that must be dealt with. A project like this without insurance is simply a dumb idea, for lack of a better term.&#x20;

This ties back into another perk of partnering with Compass Mining for this project. We would fall under their corporate insurance policy and cover the entire operation for 1.5% per year.&#x20;

If we purchased a high-end S19XP 141 TH/s miner for $5,000, it would cost us $75 per month for insurance. We will plan for this with the monthly hosting fees for each community. A portion of each month's hosting fees would go towards the insurance policy of the communities mining cluster. If the goal is to save $3500 per month for this annual policy, that money would be taken first from the monthly hosting fees collected, and then the remainder would be applied to the hosting invoice for the month.&#x20;
