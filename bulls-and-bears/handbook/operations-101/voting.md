# VOTING

The Ranch BTC Bull and BTC Bear NFT holders will help us decide future actions for each community. All NFT owners of BTC Bulls and BTC Bears will have access to voting.&#x20;

Voting power | 1 NFT owned = 1 Vote.&#x20;

Proposals and voting will be proposed and conducted in The Ranch Discord and/or via Snapshot.&#x20;

**Upcoming votes:**

1. Initially, each community will decide on the type of miners to purchase for their respective mining cluster.&#x20;
   * Cheaper Antminer S19's 100 THs with 3200 kWh, or the more expensive S19XP 134-141 THs with 3100 kWh consumption.&#x20;
   * Things to consider:&#x20;
     * S19 100 THs are cheaper, and thus we get more of them, but they also make the hosting fee more and will depreciate faster as we enter the next Bull market.&#x20;
2. As a community, do we sell off any of the Miners when the next Bull Market comes? If so, what percentage of a cluster do we sell off?
   * Miners we buy now can be flipped for 2x-3x in the next Bull market. Compass mining allows us to do this on their Market Place and deliver these assets to other customers as turn-key solutions, which can be brought online for them within a week. This is some of the value we will see working with Compass Mining.&#x20;
3. What percentage do we flip our rewards distribution to when the Bull Market comes? We are doing a 2/3 back to the project and 1/3 reinvesting in more BTC Miners. When the next Bull market comes, each community will vote on what we do next. This can be a 90/10 or 100/0 model where we don't reinvest in BTC Miners during the Bull Market. The community will ultimately decide this for themselves.&#x20;
4. How do we want to do the royalty rewards?&#x20;
   * Design a game that does this as a contest or in a pro-rata format to distribute evenly to all Early Supporters. Again, the community decides for itself.&#x20;
