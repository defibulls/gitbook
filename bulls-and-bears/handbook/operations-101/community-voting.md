# COMMUNITY VOTING

The Ranch BTC Bull and BTC Bear NFT holders will help us decide future actions for each community. All NFT owners of BTC Bulls and BTC Bears will be eligible to participate in community voting. 1 NFT owned == 1 Vote, 12 NFTS owned == 1 Vote. Whales are not going to control or govern this process. Proposals and voting will be proposed and conducted in The Ranch Discord and/or via Snapshot.&#x20;
