# HOSTING FOR BTC Bears

## HOSTING FEES FOR THE BTC Bears

The BTC Bears don't live on The Ranch as the Bulls do and thus won't pay for Hosting fees like the BTC bulls.  This makes their setup a bit easier to understand but also comes with a reduction in rewards coming back to the contract simply because we have to burn some of our mined BTC to pay for the hosting fees.&#x20;
