# REDEMPTION

Ideally, all BTC Bull and BTC Bear owners keep accounts looking good and healthy, but mistakes happen. There is a lot of value in avoiding liquidations as nobody wants to lose WBTC rewards, and the Royalty Raffle eligibility depends on a clean liquidation score of 0. &#x20;

In the event someone does get liquidated and wants to redeem their account, we have put a function in the contract that allows a user to do so for $125 for one point off the liquidation score of the user. If an account has a liquidation count of 2, it will take two of these transactions for full redemption.&#x20;

All funds from the redemption function will be sent to the Hosting Safe of that particular contract (BTC Bears or BTC Bulls). &#x20;
