## **P.E. SYSTEM**

The Ranch is a constantly growing and changing project; as a club/community, holders of the NFT(s) can shape and control the project's future. The club has implemented a tiered system for members to submit a proposal and, ultimately, for the respective community to vote to implement changes. We will call this the 'P.E,' and the steps can be seen below.
