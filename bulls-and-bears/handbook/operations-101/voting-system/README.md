# VOTING SYSTEM

The Ranch is a constantly growing and changing project; as a club/community, holders of the NFT(s) can shape and control the project's future. The club has implemented a tiered system for members to submit a proposal, and the 'RANCHERS' (All with a RANCHER discord role) within the project vote to pass or reject the proposal.
