# OFFICIAL COMMUNITY VOTE

Once a 'Proposal' has gone thru, moved to 'Elder Vote' and passed, it will move to the final stage, the 'Official Community Vote.'

* All Verified TRBC NFT Holders of that community can vote at this time.
* Polls will be found in # ï¸±official-vote-here (discord link)
* Polls are WEIGHTED, meaning if you hold 10 NFTs, you have a voting power of 10. If you hold 1, you have a voting power of 1.
* All votes are anonymous, and you can find more info about voting in ðŸ†˜ï¸±vote-help. Polls are ANONYMOUS, you can tell everyone how you voted in chat, but it won't show on the poll.&#x20;
* Poll results ARE NOT LIVE, you cannot tell how votes are panning out until it's the conclusion. This avoids herding to the popular vote or rooting for the underdog. Vote for what you think is best for The Ranch and the community that the vote is for.
* In full transparency, ALL finished votes will have the raw data visible by reacting to the " " reaction. In there, you can see how votes were weighed, who voted (not what they voted for), how votes were allocated, etc.
* Poll moves to # ï¸±vote-archive (discord link). All finished votes, whether they pass or fail, will have the results and not the raw data displayed in the vote-archive. This can be used as a reference to keep track of all community votes.
