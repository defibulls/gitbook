# PROPOSAL SYSTEM



## Proposals submitted by NFT Holders

* All proposals start in the #1 submit-proposal channel (link on discord)
* A proposal can only be directed to a single community (i.e., BTC Bulls ). If a proposal if for more than one community, separate proposals targeting each one are required.&#x20;
* Any Member can submit a proposal; The Ranch uses a google form for proposal submission. There is a google form for each submission type (Action to take or Investing) to help keep proposals organized.
* Your email is not required or logged; however, if you submit a google document or upload a file, you will need to be logged in as required by google, not The Ranch.
* If a proposal does not go thru, two weeks must elapse before the proposal can be resubmitted.

## Interests Shown by Holders

* All verified holders for the given Community have access to the #2ï¸±proposals channel (link in discord), where they can see all submitted proposals
* An 'interest' system is in place to determine the next course of action; a reaction system is in place, while discord is used as the medium.
