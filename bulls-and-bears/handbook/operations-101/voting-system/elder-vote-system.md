# ELDER VOTE SYSTEM

Once a proposal has gone thru using the interest system, it will move onto the second phase, an 'Elder Vote.'

All **ELDERS** have access to the # 3ï¸±elder-votes channel (link in discord), where all proposals that passed the proposal phase will be voted on.

Think of the Elders as a pseudo "Board of Directors," and the 'Elder Vote' will serve as another vetting process of the proposal.

* Elder Votes will begin on Wednesday of every week (if applicable) and last 48 hours.
* The system for Elder votes is a simple Y/N. If 51% is in favor, the proposal will move to the 'Official Community Vote.'
* Regarding a split vote (50% yes, 50% no), the Core Team will decide the proposal's fate.
