# AFTERMARKET NFT SALES

The Ranch BTC Bulls and BTC Bears collection will be officially listed on Opensea.io for safe aftermarket sales.  All BTC Bull and BTC Bear NFTs relisted and sold on the open market will be subject to a 12.5% royalty fee based on the sale value. This royalty will be distributed to the protocol as follows:\


* 5% of the sale price will be dispersed using the [Royalty Raffle](royalty-raffle.md). NFT sales will be one of the coolest parts of the project, as Royalty Raffles has serious potential.&#x20;
* 5% will go to The Ranch's Core Team.  These funds will be utilized to maintain the project and prepare for future expansion.
* 2.5% will go to Opensea.io as the service fee for their platform. &#x20;



&#x20;\* The Ranch Core Team is not responsible for lost, stolen, or missing NFTs. The team will do everything it can to support users. Still, ultimately, it is the responsibility of the NFT holder/Club Member to ensure the safety and security of the NFT.
