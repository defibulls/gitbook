The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

When minting BTC Bulls or BTC Bears, any wallet addresses not in the current sweepstakes will be entered into it. The sweepstake kicks off every time 100 unique wallet addresses have minted an NFT from that particular contract (BTC Bulls or BTC Bears). If users elect to mint 1 NFT or 5 NFTs, they will be entered into the minting sweepstakes only once. A single winner shall receive the entire Minting sweepstakes balance, which is then reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new NFTs are eligible to enter the minting sweepstakes on that particular contract; this doesn't matter if it's the first time a wallet address has been minted or taken part in previous Minting sweepstakes. Once it is reset, it's fair game for all.

* All entries have a 1% chance to enter
* Alternative Means of Entry (AMOE)
  * Purchase is not necessary
