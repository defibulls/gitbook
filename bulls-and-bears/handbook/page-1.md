## ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS

There **WILL** be additional revenue opportunities within The Ranch in due time.&#x20;

* Will BTC Bull or BTC Bear owners be able to vote on them? No

This is one of the most important parts of The Ranch Ecosystem. There will be no voting for projects to see if the majority want to participate. As with all things, there will be good and bad investments. The important part is that each additional idea will be 100% optional. These additional revenue streams will also come from other Animals that live within The Ranch.&#x20;

* A future example would look like adding Kangaroos to The Ranch. These will be used to purchase Kadena Miners. For example, these Kangaroo NFTs could sell for $100

If an owner of a BTC Bull/Bear thinks this is a great idea, then, by all means, take part in it and hopefully enjoy the upside from the investment. On the flip side of that, If an owner of a BTC Bull/Bear thinks this isn't on board with the idea, then stay away from them. All money to purchase these Miners will stem from the sale of Kangaroo NFTs (TRKK). The success or failure of these TRKK NFTs will have no bearing on those who do not participate. That is the foundational reason no voting will be needed. If you like the idea, jump in. Think it's not for you, then it's not for you.&#x20;
