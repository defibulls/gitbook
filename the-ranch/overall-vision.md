# OVERALL VISION

The Ranch is about building a project and community where people can take part in real-world investments with less risk and more upside. As a single community, we can come to the table and take part in deals that only wealthier individuals and businesses had the privilege of doing before. Thanks to the blockchain, we can now fractionalize the investment with smart contracts and NFTs. The overarching thesis for the project is to bridge web2 opportunities with web3 technology.

The NFT side is simply going letter for letter with the outside opportunity. BTC had to be the Bulls and Bears. If ETH were still mineable, elephants would be the animal NFT. So whatever the next idea is, you can bet that the first letters will match as more animals come to life on The Ranch.

Let's do all this as a community while learning from all the lessons that were served during the last year, such as:

* x = \[3 Arrows Capital (3AC), Celcius, Voyager, FTX, Luna, etc.]
* Why did "x" go down, and how can we avoid that and make the project more secure? If we don't take those thoughts into the future, we will fail.&#x20;
