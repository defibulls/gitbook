# OVERALL VISION

The Ranch is about building a project and community where people can take part in real-world investments with less risk and more upside. As a single community, we can come to the table and take part in deals that only wealthier individuals and businesses had the privilege of doing before.&#x20;

We will take the successful ideas before us and blend them into our ecosystem to improve on past designs, and that's where having the entire ecosystem revolve around our native token of $TRT will be instrumental. Thanks to the blockchain, we can now fractionalize the investment with smart contracts and NFTs. The overarching thesis for the project is to bridge web2 opportunities with web3 technology.

Let's do all this as a community while learning from all the lessons that were served during the last year, such as:

* x = \[3 Arrows Capital (3AC), Celcius, Voyager, FTX, Luna, etc.]
* Why did "x" go down, and how can we avoid that and make the project more secure? If we don't take those thoughts into the future, we will fail.&#x20;
