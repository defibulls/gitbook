#### Project Founder, Smart Contract Developer, Business POC &#x20;

I am a proud veteran of the US Army with eight years of service under my belt. Throughout my military career, I discovered my passion for technology, which has since become my career. I began building communication networks during my time in the service, and this led me to develop Apple iOS apps purely out of interest. Over time, I became a Network Engineer and eventually transitioned into a Systems Engineering role, where I currently work on SD-WAN projects.

However, my true passion lies in creating projects that make a difference. I am building "The Ranch" project and ecosystem for two reasons: my belief in the potential of technology and my desire to make a positive impact. I'm not doing this for financial gain; it's a genuine passion of mine.

As the founder of this project, I understand that no one cares about it as much as I do. That's why I am building it myself and putting in more effort and thought than anyone else could bring to the team. When I advertise, I will provide full transparency about the project, more so than 99% of crypto/DeFi projects. I've built the code and events that put this information clearly on the blockchain for easy consumption.
