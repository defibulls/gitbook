# KYC

If you’ve dabbled in the Defi crypto space for almost any measurable amount of time, you’ve probably witnessed or fallen victim to unforeseen project losses or exploits. These come in many forms and are not always purposeful.&#x20;

Currently, obtaining a KYC will verify individuals' existence by gathering personal information to leverage in case any financial malice events occur. This unfortunately only covers a small spectrum of possibilities that can lead to financial losses for investors. We value The Ranch contract security, our personal transparency, and investor confidence above all. Using our experiences and knowledge gained we’ve decided to approach KYC as follows.

* The Ranch project will fall under the DEFI-Bulls LLC formed in Wyoming, United States.&#x20;
* We plan to have numerous AMAs supporting each project within The Ranch where you’ll know exactly what we look like and what we are all about.
* The Ranch Bulls contract will be audited by [https://shellboxes.com/](https://shellboxes.com/) and other solidity developers in this space before deployment.
