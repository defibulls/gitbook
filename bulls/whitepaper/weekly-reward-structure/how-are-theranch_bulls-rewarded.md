# How are TheRanch\_Bulls rewarded?

At the end of every week, 50% of funds are reinvested into projects and then 40% goes back to fund the contract itself. When there is money on the contract, a reward\_bulls function will dynamically choose 100 weekly winners.

TheRanch\_Bulls NFT holders will be sent rewards in the form of stable coins. As each Bull will receive USDC, we are encouraging winners to invest that money how they wish or trade the tokens. Secondly, the value of sending each TheRanch\_Bulls NFT holder USDC is because we want all the rewards sent back to the bulls to hold their value just in case the owner doesnâ€™t check their wallet for that week.

The contract will award 100 TheRanch\_Bulls NFTs per week. The amount rewarded will increase as 50% of the weekly earnings are re-invested and compounded each week.
