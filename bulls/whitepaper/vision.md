# Vision



#### Build this project upon two pillars: Transparency & Sustainabilit**y**

Each TheRanch\_Bulls NFT holder is a key player in the broader ecosystem known as “The Ranch”. The long-term vision is for every holder of a TheRanch\_Bulls NFT to will receive weekly airdrops many times as the ecosystem grows through smart and sustainable investments. For example, during our first year, we’ll reward 100 holders weekly and 5200 holders per year once the reward process starts.

The initial investment strategy will leverage proven and established projects. One of the long-term goals of the project is to start our own delegator and validator nodes on the polygon network.  However, this does not mean that node projects will be the exclusive investment strategy behind the platform. We have been monitoring the space and participating in this space for a while now and we know the lasting power of these projects. We are striving to only invest in projects that truly have a goal, vision, and team behind them. There will be other types of platforms we invest in because the long-term potential of those projects, the team behind them, and track record is something we truly admire and covet about them.

We are aiming to compound 50% of weekly rewards back into each project and/or newer projects that allow us to get in at opportune times. The more we invest, the more reward yield will come back on a weekly basis into the contract and thus reward more TheRanch\_Bulls NFT holders.

The Ranch simply wants to under promise and over deliver. We are personally funding the startup of this project via artwork, website, and security audits. Funds that start coming back into the Core Team will play a huge huge part in expanding the Dapps we are able to provide here at "The Ranch".&#x20;
