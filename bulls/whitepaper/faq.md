11. **When are NFT holders rewarded?** Every month between the 1st and 5th. The only way you get rewarded is by still owning the NFT at this time. If you sell the NFT on the marketplace and it has a new owner, the new owner will be distributed rewards.&#x20;
12. **How will NFT holders be paid?** Mined bitcoin is converted to wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and distributed to NFT holders on the contract. Each owner of the NFT can claim their total rewards from the website at any time with no tax associated with the withdrawal.
13. **How will the initial The Ranch Bulls NFT funds be allocated?**&#x20;

    100% of initial funds for a given stockyard will purchase mining equipment and hosting packages for said stockyard.
14. **What is the percentage of bitcoin that is distributed to NFT holders for a given stockyard?**t All bitcoin mined from a stockyard during a given month goes through a two-step process:&#x20;
    1. Pay back the hosting fee for the stockyard's equipment directly using a portion of the mined bitcoin.&#x20;
    2. The remaining bitcoin is converted to WBTC and sent to the contract where 90% of the WBTC is distributed proportionally to the stockyard NFT owners.&#x20;
15. **What % will be compounded or re-invested?**&#x20;

    None; once the hosting fee is paid and WBTC is sent back to the contract, 90% of funds are sent to NFT owners for the life of the stockyard. The ASIC mining equipment has a finite life and will not run forever. Rewards are generated for the stockyard until the last miner goes offline or the equipment fails to generate a profit.
16. **Is there any long-term incentive to be a part of the project?** Yes, Stockyards have an estimated life span of 4-6 years. Once a stockyard goes offline and/or completely retired, any owner of an NFT in that retired stockyard would be entitled to a 15% discount when buying into a new stockyard. &#x20;
17. **Why not just send users bitcoin and not wrapped bitcoin?** Bitcoin is not an ERC20 token and thus doesn't work with smart contracts. The only way to bring bitcoin into our project is to convert it to a wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) which is an ERC20 token that can be used on ethereum-based smart contracts.&#x20;
18. **What is the value of WBTC?** The price of wrapped bitcoin is pegged to bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio.&#x20;
19. **Can I sell my position in the project?** Yes, if you no longer want to be in the project you will have the option to sell your NFTs (The Ranch BTC Bulls) on the marketplace.
