13. **How will winning The Ranch Bulls NFT holders be paid?** Rewards will be distributed automagically into corresponding NFT holders wallets.
14. **How are The Ranch Bulls NFT winners chosen each week?** We are using Chainlinks VRF to receive a single random number back into the contract. We take that number and expand it to generate 100 random numbers through a hashing algorithm.
15. **Should we expect the weekly rewards to be the same every week and grow in a linear fashion?** Not exactly; We are planning to invest in a multitude of projects that pay rewards at different rates. That being said, because a project like Yield Nodes pays dividends back monthly, we expect there to be a larger rewards pool on that week of the month than others. Over time, the numbers will reflect ≈40% being airdropped to the Bulls.
16. **Can I vote on future investments and project decisions?** If you hold a The Ranch Bulls NFT then yes.

19. **What % will be rewarded weekly?** 40%
20. **What % will be compounded or re-invested?** 50%
21. **What about the remaining 10%?** This will go towards payroll, The Ranch development of future projects, and any other expenses taxes, coffee, or Walmart Sushi. **NOTE**! Looking at the contract you’ll see a 20% allocation to the Dev team, this is actually a 10% allocation. The 20% logic is after the initial 50% compound / 50% Reward (see payout/Reward 101 for more clarification).
