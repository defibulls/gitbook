    1. Pay back the hosting fee for the stockyard's equipment directly using a portion of the mined bitcoin.&#x20;
    2. The remaining bitcoin is converted to WBTC and sent to the contract where 90% of the WBTC is distributed proportionally to the stockyard NFT owners.&#x20;

    None; once the hosting fee is paid and WBTC is sent back to the contract, 90% of funds are sent to NFT owners for the life of the stockyard.
