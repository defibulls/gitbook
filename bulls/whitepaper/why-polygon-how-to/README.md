# Why Polygon / How To?



Two reasons:

1. Gas on Ethereum and that would hurt our project. The idea of paying out hundreds of The Ranch Bulls each week and eating the gas on that hurts to think about. Polygon solves that problem is super cheap gas fees that make a dynamic payout structure possible.
2. Chainlink VRF support. Production network-wise, we had these choices (Ethereum, Binance, Polygon). For each Random Number Request we send to Chainlink, it cost us in terms of LINK Tokens to pay that transaction. At the time of this writing, the Link token is $15.60 and we have to pay 0.2 LINK per VRF function call on the Binance Smart chain and 0.0001 LINK when calling the VRF function on Polygon. Clear Winner for Polygon.
