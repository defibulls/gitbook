# HOW THE RANCH WORKS

## Selling the NFTs and Purchasing BTC Miners.&#x20;

The key point of the BTC Bulls is buying NFT which are means of buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster.

* The "StockYard" is how many BTC Bulls NFTs belong to a single BTC mining cluster.&#x20;

When we launch the project and start selling the BTC Bulls NFTs, the first NFT sold up to the 999th Bull all get grouped together and be a part of the StockYard1_._ The 1000th BTC Bull up to 1999th Bull belongs to StockYard2 This process continues but the key takeaway is that if you were to buy a BTC Bull or group of BTC Bulls in StockYard1, the other StockYards have **ZERO** influence on how this StockYard performs and/or revenue generated for this StockYard.

The capital raised from the selling of the stockyard1 NFTs will buy equipment for that stockyard and ONLY for that stockyard. All bitcoin that is mined from miners in a particular stockyard will be dispersed proportionally among the NFTs belonging to that stockyard. For example, if someone owns 10 NFTs in the range of 1-499, then they will get 1/50th of the mined bitcoin rewards for the life of that stockyard.&#x20;





## TOKENOMICS&#x20;

The Ranch BTC Bulls does NOT have its own native token by design. The only tokens this project will use:&#x20;

* BTC (BITCOIN)
* WBTC (WRAPPED BITCOIN)
* USDC&#x20;
* MATIC &#x20;

## WHAT IS THE HOSTING FEE RESERVE?

The key to the success and profitability of this project and each stockyard is all about timing. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $5K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. I would predict that there are 100 scam opportunities for every genuine one. After all the dust has settled on our research, we have been happy with one company in particular, Compass Mining.  At Compass mining and other facilities, they sell BTC miners with and without hosting or sometimes offer bundle packages that give buyers the best rate for each unit coupled with the best hosting/electricity fee. Hosting at the right facilities is a crucial part of this project. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s,  the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I personally am having to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what the hosting facilities, Compass Mining included, can offer us because they are making deals with the electric companies and/or providing other renewable energy options to keep the price down at the $0.07 - $0.08 range and sometimes lower.

But what about the HOSTING FEE RESERVE? What is this and why is this important? Let's play out a stockyard example. Stockyard1 sells 1000 NFTs at $150 each. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle, which would send  \~ $142,500 to the BTC MINER FUND.&#x20;

* We will take 40% of this amount and reserve it for that particular stockyard's hosting fees. 40% of $142.5K is \~$57K.&#x20;
* This leaves the stockyard \~$85.5K to purchase BTC Miners. Let's assume we can purchase Miners for $5K each, that would give us 17 S19j Pro 100 TH/s Miners for this stockyard.&#x20;

The way the hosting works at a facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner we host. Each S19j Pro cost $166.90 per month to host. Why so expensive? Firstly the cost of electricity, it would cost you more to run this at your house in electricity alone. Secondly, they provide 24/7 security and optimal warehouse conditions for each miner.  The expected monthly invoice for this stockyard is ($166.90 x 17) \~ $2837.00&#x20;

This monthly cost is what the HOSTING FEE RESERVE is designed for. Since each stockyard is built with \~$57K into the HOSTING FEE RESERVE, each stockyard can pay for nearly 20 months of hosting fees before the fund runs out.&#x20;

What happens when the HOSTING FEE RESERVE runs out? When it is depleted, the monthly BTC generated from the stockyard will have to use a portion of the BTC mined rewards to pay the invoice. This is not a problem for the project to do but we only want to do this when BTC prices are higher. It benefits every stockyard to not have to burn a larger portion of the BTC mined rewards to pay the fees in the bottom of a bear market. That would cause a stockyard to have to convert a much larger portion of the monthly mining rewards to cover the invoice. The HOSTING FEE RESERVE is designed to cover these invoices during the bear market with the expectation of BTC going up over the next 20 months when we have to use the monthly BTC mined rewards.&#x20;

## HOW LONG DOES A STOCKYARD STAY ACTIVE? &#x20;

This is another key part of the entire project with the BTC Bulls. When buying NFTs and becoming part of the project, the NFT(s) become a part of a single StockYard, depending on the index number. The mining equipment that the StockYard purchases are finite. Meaning that the ASIC mining equipment will NOT last forever. This specialized hardware works extremely hard in a data center environment and will eventually die due to hardware failure or be completely outpaced due to future technology advancements. As long as the stockyard's clear enough BTC mining rewards to remain profitable and the hardware is functioning, the stockyard will remain active. The BTC mining equipment we buy for the project will be new equipment and top-of-the-line equipment to reduce the likelihood that is unprofitable before the equipment has a hardware failure. A well-maintained ASIC Mining Miner typically lasts between 4 and 5 years, although it is not uncommon for it to last longer. There is no way for us to know how long each StockYard will remain active but knowing that 3-5 years is a likely scenario. While active, each and every month of the project, WBTC will be deposited into the smart contract and as long as the StockYard is still producing and profitable, rewards will be dispersed accordingly.



## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY STOCKYARD DIES?

The death of a StockYard is inventible as the mining cluster (all the ASIC mining machines working for that StockYard) will eventually die which means there will not be any more WBTC going back to the contract to fund the BTC Bull NFTs of that StockYard.&#x20;

When the stockyard does finally die, each NFT belonging to that stockyard will have its NFT image updated to reflect the death of it and its respective stockyard.&#x20;

When this finally does happen to each NFT in a stockyard, the owner of this NFT won't be receiving any more WBTC for the Mining Cluster of the Stockyard. However, with this sad day in mind, we want every bull to still hold value during its life mining BTC and when it does pass on to the other side. Even when the stockyard is dead, the NFT is eligible to be selected as the USDC tax collector or the WBTC tax collector. We reserved these positions to be held by the living and dead alike.
