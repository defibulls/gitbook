# How The Ranch Works

## Selling the NFTs and Purchasing BTC Miners.&#x20;

The key point of the BTC Bulls is buying NFT which are means of buying into a fractionalized BTC mining cluster.

* The "StockYard" is how many BTC Bulls NFTs belong to a single BTC mining cluster.&#x20;

When we launch the project and start selling the BTC Bulls NFTs, the first NFT sold up to the 499th Bull all get grouped together and be a part of the StockYard_0._ The 500th BTC Bull up to 999th Bull belongs to StockYard\_1. This process continues but the key takeaway is that if you were to buy a BTC Bull or group of BTC Bulls in StockYard\_0, the other StockYards have **ZERO** influence on how this StockYard performs and/or revenue generated for this StockYard.







## How are funds taken back and dispersed to the NFT holders?

Using StockYard_0 as our example: Once the hardware is installed at their hosting facilities, we only touch withdraw the funds monthly. There are two key reasons behind this. Each StockYard_ will receive an invoice for the hosting/electricity fee. This likely ranges from $0.07 - $0.08 per kWh. In monthly cost terms, this equates to every miner having to pay about $170 in electricity fees. At the beginning of the month, the hosting facility will provide the invoice and tell us how much we owe to host our equipment at their site. For the 10 miners in StockYard\_0, our invoice will be approx $1700. Compass mining allows us to pay the hosting fee directly via the BTC rewards that the Mining Cluster earned for the month.&#x20;

Once the hosting/electricity fee is paid for the month for the StockYards Mining Cluster, the rest of the BTC is then withdrawn to the project's cold storage wallet.&#x20;

From there, all BTC in the project cold storage wallet will then be converted to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This allows the project to convert the BitCoin into a standardized ERC20 format, making it able to interact with our smart contracts and thus be used on the Polygon Blockchain. Bitcoin is traded for WBTC on a 1:1 basis. Once the project's cold storage wallet has WBTC for the month, all of this WBTC is then transferred to 'The Ranch BTC Bulls' smart contract.

When funds are dispersed to NFT holders: The funds go through this process:

As the diagram explains, 85% of all the WBTC for the stockyard is then dispersed proportionally to each NFT in the StockYard. This allows the owners of the NFT to have their withdrawable allowance value updated each month. A key to this whole process is knowing that in order to be compensated, you must own the NFT at the time funds are deposited into the project.&#x20;



## How long will this process continue?&#x20;

This is another key part of the entire project. When buying NFTs and becoming part of the project, the NFT(s) then become a part of a single StockYard depending on the number of the NFT. That mining equipment that the StockYard purchases are finite. Meaning that the ASIC mining equipment WILL NOT last forever. This is specialized hardware working extremely hard in a data center and will eventually die and/or become unprofitable as technology advances. When you have to pay $170 a month for electricity, this machine must clear this amount in BTC rewards to remain profitable. The BTC mining equipment we buy for the project will be new equipment and top-of-the-line equipment to reduce the likelihood that is unprofitable before the equipment has a hardware failure. A well-maintained ASIC Mining Server typically lasts between 3 and 5 years, although it is not uncommon for it to last longer. There is no way for us to know how long each StockYard will remain active but knowing that 3-5 years is a likely scenario. Each and every month of the project, WBTC will be deposited into the smart contract and as long as the StockYard is still producing and profitable, rewards will be dispersed.



## What happens after the StockYard dies?

The death of a StockYard is inventible as the mining cluster (all the ASIC mining machines working for that StockYard) will eventually die which means there will not be any more WBTC going back to the contract to fund Bull NFTs of that StockYard. When this day finally happens, it will be a bittersweet day. The goal is that each NFT from a dead StockYard would have lived a full life mining BTC for a matter of years. This is where "Valhalla" comes into play for our bulls. From the moment a StockYard comes online and starts mining, 5% of rewards go back into the Valhalla wallet from every StockYard. These funds will be used to fund the Valhalla contract. In doing this we are creating a contract that can only be accessed if you own the correct NFTs (Graveyard Bulls).&#x20;

When your StockYard dies, each NFT is now eligible to be traded on a 1-to-1 basis for a Graveyard Bull. The Graveyard Bulls will be the only NFTs that will have access to the Valhalla reward system.  The Valhalla contract will work in a similar fashion as the BTC Bulls Contract in that it will reward NFT holders on monthly bases. The key difference will be the Valhalla contract will award NFT holders in USDC.e stable coins as opposed to WBTC.&#x20;

## Valhalla!

**Who has access to the rewards of Valhalla?** Only Graveyard Bulls.&#x20;

**Can anyone trade in their BTC Bull for a Graveyard bull?** No, the StockYard from which the BTC Bull comes from must be declared dead first. When and only when declared dead is a BTC Bull NFT allowed to be traded for a Graveyard Bull and interact with the Valhalla contract.

**Will some Graveyard bulls have an advantage over other GraveYard bulls?**  Yes, the way the contract works, there likely won't be a single Graveyard Bull NFT that will be allowed to be minted for a matter of years before the first StockYard dies. Once a StockYard finally does die, all those NFTs become eligible for Valhalla. Assuming 250 BTC Bulls are traded for GraveYard Bulls in the future, those 250 Graveyards bulls would be the only bulls splitting the monthly Valhalla payout. If the next month another 100 BTC Bulls were exchanged, then now the monthly payout gets dispersed between 350 Graveyard Bulls. As a Graveyard bull, the longer you find yourself in Valhalla, the more rewards you'll end up receiving. &#x20;
