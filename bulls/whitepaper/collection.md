# COLLECTION

#### **An uncapped collection of BTC NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.**&#x20;

There is **NOT** a cap on the total supply of NFTs for this project. The only number that matters is what we are calling the “stockyard count", which is how many BTC Bulls we segregate off into their own distinct fenced area. Each “stockyard” can have a different number of NFTs included within it. However, a single NFT can only ever belong to a single stockyard. If we set the first stockyard (stockyard1) to a count of 500, then the first 500 NFTs in sequential order would be included within it. If we then set Stockyard2 to a count of 1000 then NFT indexes 501-1500 would be included in stockyard2. &#x20;

* No whitelist&#x20;
* getting an NFT for 25$ in stockyard1 is not necessarily a better time to enter than getting a $150 NFT in stockyard12.&#x20;
  * Lower price == Less Capital to buy Miners == Less Hash Power for the BTC Mining Cluster == Less Rewards Generated and Dispersed to NFT holders of that stockyard. &#x20;
