# Collection

An uncapped collection of NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.&#x20;

There is NOT a cap on the total supply of NFTs for the project. The only number that matters is what we are calling the “stockyard count", which is how many Bulls we segregate off into their own distinct fenced area. Each “stockyard” will include 500 NFTs in sequential order. Stockyard\_1 includes NFT indexes 1-499, stockyard\_2 includes 500-599, and so on and so forth.&#x20;

The capital raised from the selling of the stockyard\_1 NFTs will buy equipment for that stockyard and ONLY for that stockyard. All bitcoin that is mined from miners in a particular stockyard and sent to that stockyard's unique wallet address and these funds will be dispersed proportionally among the stockyard's NFTs. For example, if someone owns 10 NFTs in the range of 1-499, then they will get 1/50th of the mined bitcoin rewards for the life of that stockyard.&#x20;

Mining equipment has a finite life as the ASIC hardware will not run forever. Rewards are generated for the stockyard until the last miners go offline or the equipment fails to generate a profit.&#x20;

The name of the game for this operation is buying equipment when prices are low and being able to host in facilities that are secure and can offer electricity rates between $0.07-$0.08 per kWh.

If the project goes on to sell 10,000+ NFTs or stops at 2000, that will never have any bearing on the profit of a active stockyard such as stockyard\_1 with indexes of 1-499.
