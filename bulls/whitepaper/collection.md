# Collection

#### **An uncapped collection of BTC NFTs on the Polygon Blockchain.**&#x20;

There is **NOT** a cap on the total supply of NFTs for this project. The only number that matters is what we are calling the “stockyard count", which is how many BTC Bulls we segregate off into their own distinct fenced area. Each “stockyard” can have a different number of NFTs included within it. However, a single NFT can only ever belong to a single stockyard. If we set the first stockyard (stockyard1) to a count of 500, then the first 500 NFTs in sequential order would be included within it. If we then set Stockyard2 to a count of 1000 then NFT indexes 501-1500 would be included in stockyard2. &#x20;

The capital raised from the selling of the stockyard1 NFTs will buy equipment for that stockyard and ONLY for that stockyard. All bitcoin that is mined from miners in a particular stockyard will be dispersed proportionally among the NFTs belonging to that stockyard. For example, if someone owns 10 NFTs in the range of 1-499, then they will get 1/50th of the mined bitcoin rewards for the life of that stockyard.&#x20;

* No whitelist&#x20;
* getting an NFT for 25$ in stockyard_1 is not necessarily a better time to enter than getting a $150 NFT in stockyar_\_10.&#x20;
  * Lower price == Less Capital to buy Miners == Less Hash Power for the BTC Mining Cluster == Less Rewards Generated and Dispersed to NFT holders of that stockyard. &#x20;
