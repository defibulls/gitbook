# BULLRUN

The Bullrun is a monthly competition where stakeholders can enter and compete for victory with a single entry. Once entered, participants cannot unstake their NFT until rewards for that month have been distributed. To join, participants must use the points earned from a Normal TR Bull, which is worth 18,000 points, ensuring that everyone has equal risk and sufficient points to cover the wager while preventing the NFT from being sold. At the end of the Bullrun, the winner receives 18,000 points from every participant who took part in the competition, allowing stakeholders to increase their rewards for the month during payout.

To ensure decentralization during the process, we use Chainlink's VRF functionality on the smart contract to call the winner.

It's worth noting that in our project, stakeholders are defined as individuals who own TR Bulls and actively have a TR Bull staked on the smart contract.
