The Bullrun is a monthly competition that enables stakeholders to participate with a single entry and compete for victory. However, once they join the Bullrun, their NFT cannot be un-staked until that month's rewards are distributed. To participate, each contestant wagers the points earned from a Normal TR Bull, which is valued at 18,000 points. This ensures that all participants have the same risk and enough points to cover the bet, while their NFT remains locked in the contract, making it impossible to sell. At the end of the Bullrun, the winner receives 18,000 points from each stakeholder who participated in the contest. This enables stakeholders to enhance their earned rewards for the month during the payout
