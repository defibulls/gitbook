# MINTING COST DISTRIBUTION

## COST DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL TR BULLS:

* 90% of the transaction goes to the INVESTMENT treasury wallet.&#x20;
* 5% is held for the Minting Bounty Airdrops for TR Bulls with Frogs and Turtles.
* 5% goes to MARKETING.

## COST DISTRIBUTION OF ALPHA TR BULLS:

* The primary purpose of introducing alpha TR Bulls was to participate in the AlphaShares Mining Co. Reserve NFT Sale, which will help kick-start our portfolio. The funds raised from the sale of alpha TR Bulls will be invested in the exclusive sale. In the future, a portion of the proceeds generated from the sale of alpha TR Bulls will be allocated towards covering various costs associated with our project, including website development, security audits, LLC formation, and legal team retainer fees. We are committed to being transparent and will keep our community informed about how these funds are used. Additionally, we will provide regular updates on the progress of our project.
