# MINTING COST DISTRIBUTION

## COST DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL TR BULLS:

* 83% of the transaction goes to the INVESTMENT treasury wallet.&#x20;
* 10% is sent to the War Chest treasury wallet. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project.&#x20;
* 6% is held for the Minting Bounty Airdrops for TR Bulls with Frogs and Turtles.
* 1% goes to MARKETING.

## COST DISTRIBUTION OF ALPHA TR BULLS:

* The funds raised from the sale of the alpha TR Bulls will be used to cover the costs associated with building out our project, including website development, security audits, LLC formation, and retainer fees for the legal team. We will be transparent with our community about how these funds are being allocated and provide regular updates on the progress of our project.
