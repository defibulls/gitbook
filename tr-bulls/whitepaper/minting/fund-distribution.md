# FUND DISTRIBUTION

## COST DISTRIBUTION WHEN BUYING WITH A CREDIT CARD

The smart contract itself can support purchasing with credit cards via paper.xyz

* 80% of the transaction goes to the BTC MINERS SAFE to purchase miners at the hosting facility.&#x20;
* 13% is sent to the War Chest. This money is kept in reserve if/when unseen costs arise for the project. A project failing to prepare is a project preparing to fail.&#x20;
* 6% is held for the Rarity AirDrop Payout.
* 1% goes to Marketing.

_When using a credit card to purchase TR Bulls, the buddy system reward is bypassed and will not be counted as the paper.xyz will allow you to mint with a paper wallet and then transfer to a wallet of your choice._&#x20;
