## TOP NETWORKERS

The networker count is the number of people that use your wallet address as their Buddy **AND** mint a TR Bull. Your networker count only increases for your wallet address when another person sets your address as their buddy and then mints from the contract. Doing so in reverse order will not register correctly on the contract and thus won't increase your networker count.&#x20;

* The person who refers the most addresses for the project will be the top networker and airdropped a TR Bull with a Frog.
* The person who refers the second most addresses for the project will be the second place networker and airdropped a TR Bull with a Turtle.
