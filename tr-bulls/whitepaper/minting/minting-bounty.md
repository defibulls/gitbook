#### The Minting Bounty is only for "Normal" TR Bulls, and the bounty is trying to get TR Bulls with a Turtle or a Frog.&#x20;

* When minting Normal TR Bulls with a Turtle, the owner gets a $750 airdrop with an increase in monthly accrued Bullion. &#x20;
* When minting Normal TR Bulls with a Frog, the owner gets a $1000 airdrop with an increase in monthly accrued Bullion. &#x20;
* Based on ticket submission, we distribute airdrop rewards through our Discord Server, in the order of First In, First Out (FIFO). This means that the first ticket submitted will be the first to receive the payout.

### During Presale 1:

* 1 Frog and 1 Turtle are randomly placed within the 250 allowable Normal TR Bulls. &#x20;
* The wallet address with the **most** mints during phase 1 will be airdropped with a Normal TR Bull with a Turtle.&#x20;

### During Presale 2:&#x20;

* 1 Frog and 1 Turtle are randomly placed within the 400 allowable NFTS minted.&#x20;
* The wallet address with the **most** mints during phase 2 will be airdropped with a TR Bull with a Turtle.&#x20;

### During Presale 3:&#x20;

* 1 Frog and 1 Turtle are randomly placed within the 550 allowable NFTS minted.&#x20;
* The wallet address with the most mints during phase 3 will be airdropped with a TR Bull with a Turtle.&#x20;

### During Public Sale:&#x20;

* 3 Frogs and 3 Turtles are randomly placed within the 3800 allowable NFTS minted.&#x20;
* The wallet Address with the most mints after the public sale (The total to include the mint count for a wallet during Presale 1, Presale 2, Presale 3, and the Public phase) will be airdropped a Normal TR Bull with a Turtle **AND** a TR Bull with a Frog.



## TOP NETWORKERS

The networker count is the number of people that use your wallet address as their Buddy **AND** mint a Normal TR Bull. Your networker count only increases for your wallet address when another person sets your address as their buddy and then mints from a Normal TR Bull from the contract. Doing so in reverse order will not register correctly on the contract and thus won't increase your networker count.&#x20;

* The person who refers the most addresses for the project will be the top networker and airdropped a Normal TR Bull with a Frog.
* The person who refers the second most addresses for the project will be the second place networker and airdropped a Normal TR Bull with a Turtle.
