# TIMETABLE

The Ranch's schedule holds significance in enabling the gamification element of the project. It is as follows:

At the beginning of each month:

* Capture the accumulated bullion of every TR Bull NFT owner.
* Determine the victor of the bullRun competition.&#x20;

From the 2nd to mid-month:

* Conduct community voting.
* Bull Battles games.
* Death Battles

mid-month:

* Reward TR Bulls and clear Bullion points for that given month.
