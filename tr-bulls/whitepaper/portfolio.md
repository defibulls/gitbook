# PORTFOLIO

At 'The Ranch', our mission as TR Bulls is to invest in projects that we believe in. We steer clear of inevitable Ponzi schemes that promise unrealistic returns such as the ones that claim to offer 2% daily. Instead, we focus on safe long-term investments with projects that align with our values. We believe that building our portfolio is not only about making profits but also about fostering strong relationships with players in the space who are doing things right. By investing in good players, we contribute to the growth of the DeFi community and its ecosystem.

Our project is not limited to Bitcoin mining. Rather, we specialize in diversifying our investments to spread risks and maximize profitability for our ecosystem, which includes Bullion. While profitability is essential, we understand that trust and relationships are crucial factors that can increase our likelihood of success tenfold.

Our first investment in the portfolio is Alpha Mining Co., a selected project that will collaborate with AlphaShares to expand our BTC miner cluster. This move will be pivotal in our effort to build a well-rounded portfolio that meets our investment goals.
