# NEXT INVESTMENT

## Compounding Strategy:

Our strategy for the next investment involves a compounding approach, where we will hold a community vote to decide on how much of the earned mining rewards to allocate for future investments. Currently, our disbursement strategy involves dividing the mining rewards as follows:

80% is allocated to the TR Bulls smart contract and distributed to NFT owners in a weighted format using our point system. This means that each owner receives a percentage of the deposited ERC20 token based on their points compared to the total points of all NFTs currently staked.&#x20;

An additional 10% of rewards is directed towards an investment wallet. These funds will be used to invest in various projects such as real-world assets, tokens, and more. TR Bull owners can vote on investment decisions using their respective Bullion Voting Tokens.&#x20;

Finally, 10% of rewards is directed towards The Ranch Core Team for project growth, security measures, overhead management, and marketing efforts. As we move towards our next investment, we will seek the input of our community through a vote to determine the percentage of rewards to be allocated towards future investments. The TR Bull owners will have the power to use their points to make investment decisions, ensuring a transparent and democratic process.&#x20;

The remaining percentage of rewards will continue to be distributed in accordance with our current disbursement strategy.
