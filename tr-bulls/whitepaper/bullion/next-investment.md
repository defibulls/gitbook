# COMPOUNDING

## Compounding Strategy:

Our disbursement strategy involves allocating 50% of earned mining rewards to the TR Bulls smart contract, which is then distributed to the NFT owners in a weighted format using our point system. Each owner then receives a percentage of the deposited ERC20 token based on their points compared to the total points of all NFTs currently staked.

An additional 40% of rewards are directed toward an investment wallet. These funds will be utilized for investing in other projects, real-world assets, tokens, and more. TR Bull owners can use their respective points to vote on investment decisions.

Finally, 10% of rewards are directed towards The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, overhead management, and marketing efforts."
