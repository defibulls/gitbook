# Reward / Reinvestment Strategy

#### Disbursement Strategy:

**50%** of earned mining rewards will be deposited into the smart contract of the TR Bulls. When deposited into the smart contract, The funds are dispersed to the owners of the TR Bulls NFTs in a weighted format. Each NFT's weight is added to calculate the total weight of the NFTs' owners. The owner of the NFTs is then awarded the percentage of their weight compared to the total weight currently staked of the total deposited ERC20 token.&#x20;

**40%** goes into the investment wallet. These funds will be used to invest in other projects, real-world assets, tokens, etc. TR Bull Owners use their respective weight to vote on investment decisions.

**10%** goes back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, overhead management, and marketing.&#x20;
