# POINTS



Each TR Bull NFT (Normal or Alpha) carries a specific point value. The point value for each NFT is derived from the cost of the NFT multiplied by the Magnifier value. The points for each NFT serve two primary purposes for the project:

* Reward Distribution.
* Voting Power.

| Type of TR Bull           | Cost | Magnifier |   Points  |
| ------------------------- | :--: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Regular TR Bull           |  180 |    100    |   18,000  |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Turtle |  180 |    225    |   40,500  |
| Bronze Alpha TR Bull      |  350 |    125    |   43,750  |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Frog   |  180 |    700    |  126,000  |
| Silver Alpha TR Bull      | 1000 |    150    |  150,000  |
| Gold Alpha TR Bull        | 5000 |    200    | 1,000,000 |



## Understanding Points:

* Points themselves do not have a fixed value. Instead, they serve as a basis for calculating the percentage of rewards each stakeholder receives based on their staked amount and voting activity.
* At the start of each month, the smart contract computes the total points accumulated by the staked owner across all NFTs they possess. This process captures a snapshot of the owner's holdings, which can be used to leverage their points within the ecosystem. Essentially, points serve as a means of tracking ownership and enabling participation in the system.&#x20;
* Prior to distributing rewards to stakeholders, the points are deliberately calculated to determine the reward allocation ratio for all the reward tokens for that month. This means that, for instance, if there are five investments/projects being rewarded with five distinct ERC20 tokens, the points ratio for each stakeholder remains consistent across all tokens until the entire reward distribution process is concluded
