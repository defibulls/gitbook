# POINTS



Each TR Bull NFT (Normal or Alpha) carries a specific point value. The point value for each NFT is derived from the cost of the NFT multiplied by the Magnifier value. The points for each NFT serve two primary purposes for the project:

* Reward Distribution.
* Voting Power.

| Type of TR Bull           | Cost | Magnifier |   Points  |
| ------------------------- | :--: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Regular TR Bull           |  180 |    100    |   18,000  |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Turtle |  180 |    225    |   40,500  |
| Bronze Alpha TR Bull      |  350 |    125    |   43,750  |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Frog   |  180 |    700    |  126,000  |
| Silver Alpha TR Bull      | 1000 |    150    |  150,000  |
| Gold Alpha TR Bull        | 5000 |    200    | 1,000,000 |



## Understanding Points:

* Points themselves do not have a fixed value. Instead, they serve as a basis for calculating the percentage of rewards each stakeholder receives based on their staked amount and voting activity.
* At the start of each month, the smart contract computes the total points accumulated by the staked owner across all NFTs they possess. This process captures a snapshot of the owner's holdings, which can be used to leverage their points within the ecosystem. Essentially, points serve as a means of tracking ownership and enabling participation in the system.&#x20;
* Before distributing rewards to stakeholders, the points are deliberately calculated to determine the reward allocation ratio for that month's reward tokens. This means that, for instance, if five investments/projects are rewarded with five distinct ERC20 tokens, the reward ratio for each stakeholder remains consistent across all tokens until the entire reward distribution process is concluded.&#x20;
* After rewards are dispensed, all points are wiped from stakeholders' accounts and recalculated the following month to repeat the rewarding process.
* Regardless of which NFT you stake, the point output remains the same. The crucial reward eligibility requirement is to stake at least one NFT.
* Points are only calculated for NFTs owned by the staked NFTs owner's address. Any NFT held on a marketplace transferred to another wallet is not calculated on your behalf.&#x20;
* Distributing NFTs across multiple wallets does not impact the cumulative points earned as long as they are kept within a single wallet.
* At the beginning of each month, points are computed, and by the 10th, stakeholders receive their rewards. This ensures that they have sufficient points available to participate in marketplace activities, such as wagering on bull runs and contests, that involve the transfer of points among them. These activities can be performed before reward distribution. By following this approach, even if someone owns just one Normal TR Bull, they can participate in such activities and potentially increase their monthly earnings by 10x, 100x, or even 1000x, giving them a chance to earn higher rewards.
