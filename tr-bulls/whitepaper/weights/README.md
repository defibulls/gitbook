At the core of the TR Bulls community lies our unwavering commitment to Bullion - a unique point system that drives our ecosystem and enhances its value. Our dedication to maximizing the value of Bullion is reflected in every aspect of our project. We strive to create a community of individuals who are committed to building something remarkable in the DeFi space, where passionate TR Bull holders play a pivotal role in determining the direction of the project. Our core members embody our bullish spirit and drive our project forward with a focus on real yield for our portfolio above all else. We prioritize investments in projects and opportunities that provide tangible benefits and produce significant returns, in alignment with our values of real utility, real yield, real rewards, and real relationships. Our ecosystem revolves around Bullion, ensuring that our investments generate meaningful value for our members and align with our community's core principles.



Each TR Bull NFT (Normal or Alpha) accrues a specific amount of Bullion monthly. The amount of TR Bull accrues is derived from the cost of the NFT multiplied by the Magnifier value. Accrued Bullion serves two primary purposes within The Ranches Ecosystem:

* Reward Distribution.
* Voting Power.

| Type of TR Bull           | Cost | Magnifier | Accrued Bullion  |
| ------------------------- | :--: | :-------: | :--------------: |
| Regular TR Bull           |  180 |    100    |      18,000      |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Turtle |  180 |    225    |      40,500      |
| Bronze Alpha TR Bull      |  350 |    125    |      43,750      |
| Regular TR Bull w/ Frog   |  180 |    700    |      126,000     |
| Silver Alpha TR Bull      | 1000 |    150    |      150,000     |
| Gold Alpha TR Bull        | 5000 |    200    |     1,000,000    |



In terms of monthly Bullion accumulation, Gold Alpha TR Bulls have the highest earning potential, but they are relatively rare within the collection. On the other hand, when evaluating the Bullion per dollar cost, Turtles and Frogs stand out as the most cost-effective options, as they can be minted during all phases at a price range of $103 to $180, and are also available for free minting to eligible individuals.

## Understanding Bullion:&#x20;

* Bullion itself does not have a fixed value. Instead, it serves as a basis for calculating the percentage of rewards each stakeholder receives based on their staked amount and voting activity.
* At the start of each month, the smart contract computes the total bullion accumulated by the staked owner across all NFTs they possess. This process captures a snapshot of the owner's holdings, which can be used to leverage their bullion within the ecosystem. Essentially, bullion serves as a means of tracking ownership and enabling participation in the system.
* Before distributing rewards to stakeholders, the bullion is deliberately calculated to determine the reward allocation ratio for that month's reward tokens. This means that, for instance, if five investments/projects are rewarded with five distinct ERC20 tokens, the reward ratio for each stakeholder remains consistent across all tokens until the entire reward distribution process is concluded.
* After rewards are dispensed, all bullion is wiped from stakeholders' accounts and recalculated the following month to repeat the rewarding process. Regardless of which NFT you stake, the bullion output remains the same. The crucial reward eligibility requirement is to stake at least one NFT.
* Bullion is only calculated for NFTs owned by the staked NFTs owner's address. Any NFT held on a marketplace transferred to another wallet is not calculated on your behalf. Distributing NFTs across multiple wallets does not impact the cumulative bullion earned compared to storing them in a single wallet.
* At the beginning of each month, bullion is computed, and by the 10th, stakeholders receive their rewards. This ensures that they have sufficient bullion available to participate in marketplace activities, such as wagering on bull runs and contests, that involve the transfer of bullion among them. These activities can be performed before reward distribution. By following this approach, even if someone owns just one Normal TR Bull, they can participate in such activities and potentially increase their monthly earnings by 10x, 100x, or even 1000x, giving them a chance to earn higher rewards.
*   Once all NFTs are sold, the total supply of Bullion will be capped at 107,711,500, and there are no means to increase the total supply of Bullion. This ensures that the Bullion value is not inflationary and remains stable. Any additional Bullion earned through Bull Battles has a net zero effect since it is transferred from one NFT owner to another and not created out of thin air.

    Death Battles, conversely, are a way to increase the amount of Bullion for an NFT. However, this will also reduce the overall supply of Bullion, as the defeated NFT will only receive 75% of the Bullion from the battle. This mechanism ensures that Bullion remains deflationary and scarce, adding value to the NFTs and incentivizing community engagement.
