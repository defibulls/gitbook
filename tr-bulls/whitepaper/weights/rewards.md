## INVESTMENT REWARDS

Rewards are not paid as dividends, meaning you do not get rewards for holding a TR Bull in your wallet. All rewards are given to those TR Bull owners who collaborate and help the community make decisions.&#x20;

#### What makes me eligible for rewards?&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">A TR Bull owner must stake a single NFT on the rewards contract.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Submit votes to guide the direction of the community.</mark>&#x20;



#### Disbursement Strategy:

**50%** of earned mining rewards will be deposited into the smart contract of the TR Bulls. When deposited into the smart contract, The funds are dispersed to the owners of the TR Bulls NFTs in weight format. Each NFT's weight is added to calculate the total weight of the NFTs' owners. The owner of the NFTs is then awarded the percentage of their weight compared to the total weight currently staked of the total deposited awards.&#x20;

**40%** goes into the investment wallet. These funds will be used to invest in other projects, real-world assets, tokens, etc. TR Bull Owners use their respective weight to vote on investment decisions.

**10%** goes back to The Ranch Core Team for continued project growth, security measures, overhead management, and marketing.&#x20;
