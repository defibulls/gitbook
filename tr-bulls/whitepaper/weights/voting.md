# VOTING

## Voting Power

Voting power is a crucial element of our DAO. Similar to reward distribution, voting allows every TR Bull owner to contribute to our community. To be eligible to vote, a TR Bull owner must stake at least one NFT on the rewards contract.

The voting power of each individual is determined by the amount of bullion they hold. For example, if person 'p7' has accumulated 1,000,000 bullion and person 'p1' has 18,000, 'p7' would have significantly more voting power within our community than 'p1'.

At the start of each month, the amount of Bullion earned is added to two areas of your account: rewards and voting. While your voting bullion remains constant for voting purposes, your rewards bullion can be leveraged in Bull Battles and other activities to potentially earn even more rewards.
