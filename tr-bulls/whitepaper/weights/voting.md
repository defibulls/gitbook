# VOTING

## Voting Power

Voting power is an essential aspect of our DAO. Similar to reward distribution, voting enables every TR Bull owner to contribute to our community. A TR Bull owner must stake at least one NFT on the rewards contract to be eligible to vote.

#### Voting Power Explained

| Person |    Mint Count / Type   | Points  |
| :----: | :--------------------: | :-----: |
|   p1   |        1 TR Bull       |  18000  |
|   p2   |       3 TR Bulls       |  54000  |
|   p3   |    1 TR Bull w/ Frog   |  126000 |
|   p4   |   1 TR Bull w/ Turtle  |  40500  |
|   p5   | 1 Bronze Alpha TR Bull |  43750  |
|   p6   | 1 Silver Alpha TR Bull |  150000 |
|   p7   |  1 Gold Alpha TR Bull  | 1000000 |
|   p8   |        1 TR Bull       |  18000  |



The voting power of each individual is determined by the number of points they hold. For instance, if person 'p7' has accumulated 1,000,000 points and person 'p1' has 18,000, 'p7' would wield significantly more voting power within our community than 'p1'.
