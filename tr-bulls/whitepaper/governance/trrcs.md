# TRRCs

The Ranch Request for Comments (TRRCs) are the first step in the governance improvement process. Anyone can participate in the Governance Forum, create TRRCs, and vote on improvements. â€‹

### 1. Submitting a TRRC <a href="#1.-submitting-an-arc" id="1.-submitting-an-arc"></a>

When submitting a TRRC on the governance forum, the post should contain all the pertinent information of the proposed final TRIP. This will enable the community to offer feedback, suggest improvements, and possibly collaborate to refine the proposal.

**Minimum requirements**

At a minimum, the TRRC must include:

* Short and concise title of the TRRC.
* A short and concise description of the proposal.
* The rationale for the TRRC, e.g. why?
* The title of the forum post must include 'TRRC:' with the short title of the TRRC. E.g. `TRRC: Activation of V2 Governance Model`.
* A community poll that community members can use to vote.

### 2. Commenting / discussion period <a href="#2.-commenting-discussion-period" id="2.-commenting-discussion-period"></a>

Following the posting of the Ranch Governance proposal on the forum, an open commenting and discussion period will commence. All inquiries and feedback received will be acknowledged and considered to further refine the TRRC. Upon obtaining an adequate number of off-chain votes, the TRRC will be qualified for submission as a TRIP. &#x20;
