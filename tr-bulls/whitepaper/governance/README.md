# GOVERNANCE

The Ranch Governance process is a novel approach to on-chain governance that enables efficient decision-making through a unique evolution of voting using the Bullion tokens. This transparent and inclusive process ensures the protocol can swiftly respond to market changes and upgrade essential aspects of the system over time. By leveraging the power of the Bullion token, the Ranch Governance process delivers unparalleled flexibility and adaptability to the protocol.



### Governance Power

TR Bull holders receive governance powers proportionally to the sum of their monthly Bullion Tokens.

There are initially two powers associated with each Bullion Voting Token:

* The **proposal power** gives access to creating and sustaining a proposal.
* The **voting power** is used to vote for or against existing proposals.



### Governance Proposals

The steps for a successful governance proposal are:

1. Create a The Ranch Request for Comments (TRRC)  to share on the forum and exchange with the community.
2. Use off-chain voting to gauge community sentiment and preferences.
3. Prepare The Ranch Improvement Proposal (TRIP) based on the rough consensus gathered via off-chain and prepare the necessary payloads.
4. Submit the TRIP to the protocol for a governance vote.

If successful, the TRIP's payload will be executed and implemented.
