# TRIPs

The Ranch Improvement Proposals (TRIPs) can be submitted by any community member who possesses sufficient propositional power (TR Bull Holder). It is recommended to initiate the process with a forum discussion to receive feedback and suggestions, followed by a rough consensus poll before moving to the resource-intensive TRIP phase.

## 1. Writing a TRIP

A TRIP reviewer will assign a TRIP number, and its status should start at WIP (Work In Progress). The TRIP should include all relevant information, as well as links to the forum discussion and off-chain vote. Once the TRIP is written and polished, it needs to be submitted.

## 2. Preparing the TRIP for on-chain governance

The reviewed TRIP is merged into the TRIP repository and passes the review pipeline (currently performed by The Ranch Guardian Team).

## 3. Submitting the TRIP for on-chain governance

A Guardian Team member can now submit the TRIP for on-chain governance.&#x20;

For submitting a proposal, there are two types of proposals with different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal. Critical proposals that affect governance consensus require more voting time and a higher vote differential, whereas proposals affecting only protocol parameters require less voting time and can be quickly implemented.
