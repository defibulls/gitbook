# DELEGATION

## What is Delegation?

Delegation is a mechanism through which TR Bull Holders can entrust their voting power to one or more chosen delegates. These delegates can then vote using the Voting Bullion Tokens delegated to them. Delegates are transferred the Voting Bullion Tokens on the smart Contract for that given month. TR Bull Holders are always able to vote on proposals directly if they do not wish to delegate their Voting Bullion tokens. The Ranch has two varieties of delegates.

### Recognized Delegates <a href="#recognized-delegates" id="recognized-delegates"></a>

Recognized Delegates are whitelisted by the Guardians of The Ranch. They must meet requirements for consistent participation in votes, and communication with the community. In exchange for meeting these requirements, Recognized Delegates are compensated with a Rewards Bullion Token Boost and are featured more prominently on voting frontends. Recognized Delegates act as a bridge between vote outcomes and other actors by actively and transparently communicating with The Ranch community.

### Shadow Delegates <a href="#shadow-delegates" id="shadow-delegates"></a>

Shadow Delegates are permissionless, with no requirements or responsibilities beyond those they have agreed on directly with holders who delegate to them.
