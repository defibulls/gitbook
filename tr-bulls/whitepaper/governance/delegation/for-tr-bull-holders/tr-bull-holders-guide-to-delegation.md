# TR Bull Holders Guide to Delegation

## Four Key Points

There are five key points to keep in mind when considering delegating your Voting Bullion Tokens.

**Trust** - Delegation is an expression of the TR Bulls Holder's trust in the delegate.

**Incentives** - Your delegate will have different incentives than you. These may not be solely financial. These may not always be permanent.

**Recognition** - Recognized Delegates are safer than Shadow Delegates (but not by much).

**Cost-Benefit** - Responsible delegation is much, much cheaper than responsible voting and almost as good for The Ranch Protocol.



## Trust

Trust has taken on a bad name in the crypto-space. Frequently this is for a good reason. Nevertheless, trust plays a key role in life and human interaction. Trust comes into play heavily when delegating.

**Delegation is an expression of the TR Bull Holder's trust in the delegate**

When delegating, the fundamental trade-off made by TR Bull Holders is to benefit from an increased efficiency of governance, at the cost of increased trust requirements and centralization. These costs are unavoidable, though they can be minimized by delegating responsibly.

Ultimately The Ranch Protocol (and the DAO) needs effective governance in order to operate successfully. If The Ranch cannot operate successfully, then the Bullion tokens will lose value. Likewise, if delegates collude and attack The Ranch Protocol, then the Bullion tokens will lose value.

TR Bull Holders must create a balance between these two extremes that results in an operable protocol while minimizing the risk of governance attack.



## Incentives

Humans are both dynamic and varied in their motivations, and we should expect the same from delegates. Incentives in this context refer to more than just financial incentives.

**Your delegate will have different incentives than you. These may not be solely financial. These may not always be permanent.**

The table below shows a selection of relevant incentives that delegates may have. It is not exhaustive.

| Source                                      | Incentive Type           | Stability | Governance Controllable |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------- |
| Holds TR Bulls                              | Extrinsic - Financial    | Unstable  | No                      |
| Holds vested MKR                            | Extrinsic - Financial    | Stable    | No                      |
| Reward Bullion Boost                        | Extrinsic - Financial    | Variable  | Yes                     |
| The Ranch Protocol is primary employment    | Extrinsic - Financial    | Variable  | Yes                     |
| Being a delegate delivers status + prestige | Extrinsic - Reputational | Unstable  | No                      |
| Values delegate work                        | Intrinsic - Character    | Variable  | No                      |
| The Ranch Protocol benefits society         | Intrinsic - Character    | Variable  | Variable                |
| Morality                                    | Intrinsic - Character    | Variable  | No                      |

There are several items of note that can be taken from this table:

1. Very few incentives are verifiably stable.
2. Governance only has control over a few incentives.
3. The character of the delegate is important.

To simplify this somewhat, if you are considering delegating your Voting Bullion Tokens. Ask yourself the following questions:

* Does this delegate hold a fair amount of TR Bulls?&#x20;
* Is this delegate paid by the protocol or an external actor? If the latter, by whom, and what is their motivation?
* Is this delegate reliant on The Ranch Protocol for their financial stability?
* Does this delegate have a reputation on the line? Do they care about their reputation?
* Does this delegate enjoy being a delegate? Have they consistently enjoyed it in the past?
* Does this delegate believe The Ranch Protocol is a public good?
* Does this delegate display strong morals? Are they trustworthy?

Many of these questions are hard to answer, hence the requirements for trust:

* ...that the delegate is accurately representing their incentives.
* ...that you have accurately judged the delegate’s represented incentives.
* ...that the delegate’s incentives are stable over time or that you will be engaged enough to manage changes.

## Recognition

The split into Recognized and Shadow Delegates has a few advantages, one of which is the integration of reputational collateral for the Recognized Delegates. By requirement, they are publicly known; this gives them an incentive to do a good job with any Voting Bullion Tokens delegated to them on pain of damage to their reputation.

**Recognized Delegates are safer than Shadow Delegates (but not by much).**

However, reputation is only one source of incentive alignment, it helps, but it is not a guarantee that a delegate is trustworthy.

By default, Shadow Delegates lack even this incentive alignment. The Guardians recommend that TR Bull Holders consider delegating to a Shadow Delegate only under the following circumstances:

* The Shadow Delegate verifiably holds more TR Bullion Tokens than you plan to delegate to them for the duration of the delegate contract lifespan.
* You have a personal or professional relationship with the Shadow Delegate that the Shadow Delegate values.
* There are no Recognized Delegates.
* The Ranch Voting Bullion Tokens are concentrated in the hands of too few Recognized Delegates.

## Cost-Benefit

The cost-benefit calculation for the governance of the The Ranch Protocol has never been particularly favorable to TR Bull holders. There is much to govern and much to keep up with. Delegation represents a long-awaited improvement to this calculus.

As a general rule, governance safety and effectiveness decrease as you go down the following scale:

* **Responsible Voting** (Best Action)
* **Responsible Delegation** (Best Action for Cost)
* **Apathy**
* **Irresponsible Voting**
* **Irresponsible Delegation** (Worst Action)

**Responsible delegation is much, much cheaper than responsible voting and almost as good.**

Delegation increases the variability of outcomes relative to individuals voting. The chance for greater governance effectiveness exists, but it is balanced by a greater amount of centralization and collusion risk.

With individuals voting, there is less chance for effective governance but also less chance for malicious governance. With delegation, there is a greater chance for both outcomes. For this reason, we view apathy as preferable to irresponsible delegation.

To aid in cost-benefit judgments, here is our estimate of the cost to the individual in terms of responsible delegation to one or more Recognized Delegates. Note that delegate contracts currently expire every year. So these should be considered annual costs:

* Spend a few hours reading over the Recognized Delegate platforms, and figure out which delegates care about what you care about.&#x20;
* Spend 30 minutes thinking about incentives and trust in relation to your chosen delegate(s).
* Spend gas to delegate your MKR to your chosen delegates.
* Spend an hour each month to check in. Check your delegates are still active and check their metrics are still good.

Ineffective or participation-starved governance will kill The Ranch Protocol over the long term just as surely as governance attacks will in the short term.

If you hold non-trivial amounts of capital in the Voting Bullion tokens, you should seriously consider delegating responsibly.
