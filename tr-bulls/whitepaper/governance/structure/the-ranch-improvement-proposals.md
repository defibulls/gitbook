# The Ranch Improvement Proposals

## What is a TRIP?

A TRIP (The Ranch Improvement Proposal) is a document that regulates and defines the behavior of The Ranch Governance, The Ranch DAO, or The Ranch Protocol. They are standardized documents voted upon by Bullion Governance. TRIPs can be added, amended, replaced, and removed.

TRIPs should be written to follow these:

**Specificity:** A TRIP must define and address a specific behavior or single responsibility. Overburdened TRIPs are not allowed.

**Completeness:** A TRIP must be thorough. Relevant, specific particulars must not be left undefined or unreferenced.

**Avoid overlap:** Multiple TRIPs must not implement the same type of behavior independently.

**Clarity:** A TRIP must not have equally valid conflicting interpretations. A TRIP must be as straightforward to understand as possible.

**Brevity:** A TRIP must be as short as possible, including only what is essential given the other core principles.
