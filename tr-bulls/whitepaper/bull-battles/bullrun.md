# BULLRUN

The Bullrun is a monthly competition designed for TR Bull stakeholders who have staked a TR Bull on the smart contract. Participants are not required to pay any fee to enter the contest and must be aware that their participation is considered a donation to the project. There should be no expectation of a return or reward, as the Bullrun is a raffle and not a lottery.

Once participants enter the Bullrun, their NFT cannot be unstaked until the winner is declared for that month's Bullrun. To join, each participant must donate the bullion earned from a Normal TR Bull worth 18,000 bullion. This ensures that everyone has an equal risk and sufficient bullion to cover the wager while preventing the NFT from being sold.

The winner of the Bullrun competition is randomly selected through the use of Chainlink's VRF functionality on the smart contract, ensuring a decentralized selection process. The winner will receive 18,000 Bullion for each participant in the Bullrun, which was collected through the donations of all participants who entered the competition. This means that the winner will receive a sum equal to the total number of participants multiplied by 18,000 Bullion, maximizing the reward potential for stakeholders.

It's important to note that the Bullrun operates as a raffle with the project's own money in the form of Bullion, making it safer from a legal perspective. Participants should fully understand that their donation is not an investment and they have no ownership rights or expectation of profit. Nonetheless, the Bullrun presents a fantastic opportunity for stakeholders to support the project and potentially win a prize with a low initial donation.
