# BULLRUN

The Bullrun is a monthly competition that allows TR Bull stakeholders, who own and have staked their bullion on the smart contract, to participate in a single-entry competition for victory. Once a participant enters the Bullrun, their NFT cannot be unstaked until the rewards for that month have been distributed. To join, each participant must use the bullion earned from a Normal TR Bull, which is worth 18,000 bullion. This ensures that everyone has an equal risk and sufficient bullion to cover the wager while preventing the NFT from being sold.

At the end of the Bullrun, the winner is awarded 18,000 bullion from every participant who took part in the competition, thus enabling stakeholders to increase their rewards for the month during the payout. Additionally, we utilize Chainlink's VRF functionality on the smart contract to call the winner, keeping everything as decentralized as possible during this process. It's worth noting that this Bullrun idea has huge potential. By owning a single TR Bull and participating in the Bullrun, a person can potentially receive rewards as if they owned 10, 1000, or even 1000+ bulls, depending on the number of participants in the Bullrun. This presents a fantastic opportunity for stakeholders to maximize their rewards and diversify their holdings with a low initial investment.
