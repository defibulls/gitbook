# Paper Rock Scissors



1. Each player submits an NFT to represent their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The NFTs can be designed to visually represent each option, making the game more engaging and interactive.
2. The first player selects their option by submitting their NFT. For example, if they submit an NFT that represents "rock", they have chosen "rock" as their option.
3. The second player selects their option by submitting their NFT, but they can only select "paper" or "scissors" since "rock" has already been chosen by the first player.
4. The third player selects their option by submitting their NFT, but they can only select the option that has not yet been chosen by the other two players.
5. Using Chainlink VRF functionality, a random number is generated that determines the outcome of the game. This ensures that the game is fair and unbiased, as the random number is generated using a secure and decentralized oracle network.
6. The winner is determined based on the traditional "paper, rock, scissors" rules using the options chosen by the players and the random number generated by Chainlink VRF. The player who wins receives the Bullion that is subtracted from the two losers as a reward, while the two players who lose have their accounts subtracted a certain amount of Bullion, such as 9,000 Bullion Tokens.
7. The game can be repeated with new NFTs for each round, making it a fun and engaging way for players to compete and potentially earn rewards.
