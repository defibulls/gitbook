# CTAB

## Cattle Tag Arithmetic Bounty



Each TR Bull on the Property has a cattle tag on their ear. Each Cattle Tag has an arithmetic symbol or number placed on it. &#x20;

* (
* )
* !
* ^
* \*
* \+
* \-
* &#x20;0 through 50

The numbers and arithmetic symbols are used to create the bounty number.

At the beginning of the month, a tweet from the official Twitter account will be put out with the CTAB number, and the first person to submit a CTAB ticket with the winning information within our Discord is declared the winner. &#x20;

### Rules:&#x20;

* CTAB ticket must be submitted within discord.&#x20;
* Must have all the needed NFTs in a single wallet and **only** those NFTs.&#x20;
  * &#x20;Making them all sit in one wallet makes it fair for everyone because a whale would have to move these NFTs from their regular wallet into this new wallet. That allows others to buy them up off the secondary market in an equal amount of time.&#x20;
* CTAB ticket must provide a wallet address for the team to verify and the correct order for their NFTs.&#x20;

### Example:

The CTAB number is 104 for the month. This allows for multiple paths to get to arrive a the winning number. Here are four successful combinations:&#x20;

* 52 \* 2 (3 TR Bulls)
* 60 + 40 + 4 (5 TR Bulls)
* 20 \* 5 + 4 (5 TR Bulls)
* 50 \* 3 - 30 - 16 ( 7 TR Bulls)
