# CTMB

## Cattle Tag Math Bounty



Every TR Bull located on the Property has an ear tag for identification purposes, and on each of these ear tags is a number or arithmetic symbol. These numbers and symbols are used to generate the bounty number for each month, which becomes the target for the "Produce It" game where players compete to collect the required NFTs.

To participate in this "Produce It" game, players need to keep an eye out for a tweet from the official Twitter account at the beginning of each month. This tweet will provide information about the CTMB number and the number of allowed operators that can be used to arrive at the winning number. Alternatively, the tweet may provide clues about where the CTMB number can be found.

Each ear tag or cattle tag belongs to one of two groups: Operators or Super-Primes. The Operators group includes four symbols: multiplication (x), division (/), addition (+), and subtraction (-). These symbols are used to perform mathematical operations on the Super-Prime numbers.

The Super-Prime numbers are a special set of prime numbers between 0 and 1000. They include the following numbers: 3, 5, 11, 17, 31, 41, 59, 67, 83, 109, 127, 157, 179, 191, 211, 241, 277, 283, 331, 353, 367, 401, 431, 461, 509, 547, 563, 587, 599, 617, 709, 739, 773, 797, 859, 877, 919, 967, and 991. These Super-Prime numbers are used in the "Produce It" game to create the CTMB number, which players must try to arrive at using the allowed Operators and Super-Prime numbers.



_**What is a super-prime number?** Let's take 211 for example. A prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and so on, are prime numbers. In the sequence of prime numbers, 211 is the 47th prime number. A super-prime number is a prime number that has a prime number as its position in the sequence of all prime numbers. In other words, if we look at the sequence of prime numbers, 211 is at the 17th position, and 17 is also a prime number. Therefore, 211 is a super-prime number._

### **Visual difference:**&#x20;

The ear tags on the NFTs have a yellow-ish color for super-prime numbers and a more reddish color for operators.

### Rules:&#x20;

* You must own all the needed NFTs in a single wallet and ONLY those NFTs. Making them all sit in one wallet makes it fair for everyone because a whale would have to move these NFTs from their regular wallet into this new wallet. That allows others to buy them up off the secondary market in an equal amount of time.
* Any NFTs currently being staked for governance and rewards will not count towards the required NFTs in the wallet. This is because the ownership of these NFTs technically belongs to the governance contract, rather than the individual wallet that needs to submit ownership of the required NFTs.
* To claim the prize, the winner must submit a ticket within the official Discord server with their wallet address and proof of ownership of the required NFTs. This allows for a private conversation with the team and verification of ownership. The winner will be the first person to submit a valid ticket with all the necessary information, including the equation used to arrive at the winning number. Please note that the order of operations matters, and the equation "2 \* 6 + 4" does not equal "2 + 6 \* 4".

### Examples:

For this month's "Produce It" game, the bounty number is 17066, and there are 2 operators that can be used in different combinations to arrive at the winning number. Here are the 2 successful combinations, with the operators indicated in red:&#x20;

* 109 <mark style="color:red;">+</mark> 31 <mark style="color:red;">x</mark> 547 (5 TR Bulls)&#x20;
* 919 <mark style="color:red;">+</mark> 67 <mark style="color:red;">x</mark> 241 (5 TR Bulls)&#x20;

If the monthly bounty allowed for 3 operators, it would push the possible solutions up to 6 with these being the successful combinations:

* 31\*547+109
* 3_241+59_277
* 41_461-5_367
* 41_563-11_547

Using the ear tags' numbers allows for many paths to arrive at the bounty number, and the number of possible combinations grows as the number of operators increases. For example, if the bounty number was 17066 and instead allowed 3 operators, there would be 337 different combinations of numbers and operators that could arrive at this number. Allowing 4 operators increases the possible solutions to 5241.&#x20;
