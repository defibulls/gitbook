## Cattle Tag Math Bounty



Each TR Bull on the Property has a cattle tag on their ear. Each Cattle Tag has an arithmetic symbol or number placed on it. &#x20;



* &#x20;\*  (Multiplication)&#x20;
* /   (Division)
* \+  (Addition)
* \-   (Subtraction)&#x20;
* &#x20;prime numbers between 0 - 100
  * \[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

The numbers and arithmetic symbols are used to create the bounty number for the month.

At the beginning of the month, a tweet from the official Twitter account will be put out with the CTAB number or information where this number can be found. The first person to reply to the twitter post with the winning information is declared the winner. &#x20;

### Rules:&#x20;

* You must own all the needed NFTs in a single wallet and **ONLY** those NFTs.&#x20;
  * &#x20;Making them all sit in one wallet makes it fair for everyone because a whale would have to move these NFTs from their regular wallet into this new wallet. That allows others to buy them up off the secondary market in an equal amount of time.

### Example:

The CTAB number is 104 for the month. This allows for multiple paths to get to arrive a the winning number. Here are four successful combinations:&#x20;

* 52 \* 2 (3 TR Bulls)
* 60 + 40 + 4 (5 TR Bulls)
* 20 \* 5 + 4 (5 TR Bulls)
* 50 \* 3 - 30 - 16 (7 TR Bulls)
