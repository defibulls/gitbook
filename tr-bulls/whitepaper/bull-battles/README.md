# BULL BATTLES

Bull Battles are exciting competitions where NFT owners can compete against each other and wager their accrued bullion for a chance to win even more. These games are designed to be fun and engaging, offering players a variety of challenges that range from skill-based to games of chance. By participating in Bull Battles, players can earn additional bullion and enhance their monthly rewards, all while enjoying the camaraderie of the TR Bull community.

It's worth noting that the amount of Bullion available for each month is fixed and depends on the NFT owned by each player. No new Bullion is created out of thin air to give as bonuses, so all the Bullion earned during Bull Battles comes from other community members who participate in the activities. However, this doesn't mean that those who don't participate will miss out on a share of the rewards. The amount of Bullion available won't decrease for non-participants.

That said, participating in Bull Battles offers a unique opportunity for players to significantly increase their percentage of the Bullion pool, although there is a risk of losing a portion of it. Whether you're a casual player or a seasoned competitor, Bull Battles have something for everyone to enjoy. So come join the fun and see what you can win!
