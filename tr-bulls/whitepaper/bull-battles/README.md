# BULL BATTLES

Bull Battles are exciting competitions where NFT owners can compete against each other and wager their accrued bullion for a chance to win even more. These games are designed to be fun and engaging, offering players a variety of challenges that range from skill-based to games of chance. By participating in Bull Battles, players can earn additional bullion and enhance their monthly rewards, all while enjoying the camaraderie of the TR Bull community.

It should be noted that the monthly Bullion supply is predetermined based on the NFTs held by individual players, and there is no creation of additional Bullion as bonus incentives. Hence, all Bullion earned during Bull Battles is sourced from other community members who participate in these activities. Nonetheless, abstaining from participation does not lead to a loss of rewards. The percentage of rewards received by an NFT holder remains constant against the total Bullion amount, meaning that there is no reduction in rewards for non-participation.

That said, participating in Bull Battles offers a unique opportunity for players to significantly increase their percentage of the Bullion pool, although there is a risk of losing a portion of it. Whether you're a casual player or a seasoned competitor, Bull Battles have something for everyone to enjoy. So come join the fun and see what you can win!
