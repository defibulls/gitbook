# VOTING

## Voting Power

Voting works the same way as paying out rewards. Voting on what we do as a community is what makes every TR Bull owner a contributor to our DAO.

#### Voting Power Explained

| Person | Mint Count / Type      | Calculated Weight |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| p1     | 1 TR Bull              | 18000             |
| p2     | 3 TR Bulls             | 54000             |
| p3     | 1 TR Bull w/ Frog      | 126000            |
| p4     | 1 TR Bull w/ Turtle    | 40500             |
| p5     | 1 Bronze Alpha TR Bull | 43750             |
| p6     | 1 Silver Alpha TR Bull | 150000            |
| p7     | 1 Gold Alpha TR Bull   | 1000000           |
| p8     | 1 TR Bull              | 18000             |



Votes are ultimately decided by the amount of power behind them. Person "p7" would carry more voting power for our community than a "p1".&#x20;
