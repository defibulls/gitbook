## INVESTMENT REWARDS

Rewards are not paid as dividends, meaning you do not get rewards for holding a TR Bull in your wallet. All rewards are given to those TR Bull owners who are contributors that help the community make decisions.&#x20;

#### What makes me eligible for rewards?&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">A TR Bull owner must stake a single NFT on the rewards contract.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Submit votes to guide the direction of the community.</mark>&#x20;



#### Reward Distribution Explained:

For this simplistic example, let's assume we have minted 10 NFTS from 10 wallet addresses. To be eligible for rewards, each wallet address must stake a single NFT owned by that particular wallet to receive rewards; for this example will assume each person has an NFT staked.
