## INVESTMENT REWARDS

Rewards are not paid as dividends, meaning you do not get rewards for holding a TR Bull in your wallet. All rewards are given to those TR Bull owners who are contributors to TRBC. &#x20;

#### What makes me a contributor and eligible for rewards?&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">A TR Bull owner must stake a single NFT on the rewards contract.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Submit vote(s) to guide the direction of the community.</mark>&#x20;



#### Reward Distribution Explained:

Here's an easier way to understand how reward distribution works:

Let's say there are 10 unique digital items (NFTs) created by 10 different people. To be able to earn rewards, each person must use one of their NFTs as collateral (or "stake") in a smart contract. For this example, let's assume everyone has already done this.

Now, let's say that a total of $1,000 is put into the smart contract to be distributed as rewards for the current month. The total value of all the staked NFTs combined is calculated to be 1,450,250.

Based on this calculation, each person will receive a reward proportional to the percentage of the total value of their staked NFT compared to the total value of all staked NFTs, multiplied by the total amount of money in the reward pool.

| Person |    Mint Count / Type   | Accrued Bullion | % of Total Bullion |  Reward |
