## INVESTMENT REWARDS

Rewards are not paid as dividends, meaning you do not get rewards for holding a TR Bull in your wallet. All rewards are given to those TR Bull owners who are contributors to TRBC. &#x20;

#### What makes me a contributor and eligible for rewards?&#x20;

* <mark style="color:purple;">A TR Bull owner must stake a single NFT on the rewards contract.</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;">Submit vote(s) to guide the direction of the community.</mark>&#x20;



#### Reward Distribution Explained:

Let's consider a simple example where 10 NFTs have been minted from 10 different wallet addresses. In order to be eligible for rewards, each wallet address must stake one NFT owned by that particular wallet. For the purpose of this example, let's assume that each person has already staked an NFT.

A total of $1,000 worth of USDC is deposited into the smart contract for this month's reward cycle. The total bullion for all staked addresses is calculated to be 1,450,250.

Each person is then rewarded a percentage of the total bullion multiplied by the total deposit.
