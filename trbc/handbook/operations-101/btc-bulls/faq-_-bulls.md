11. **When are NFT holders rewarded?** Every month between the 1st and 5th. The only way you get rewarded is by owning the BTC Bull at this time. If you sell the NFT on a marketplace and it has a new owner, the new owner will be distributed monthly rewards.&#x20;
12. **How will NFT holders be paid?** Mined bitcoin is converted to wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) and distributed to NFT holders on the contract. &#x20;
13. **What is the percentage of bitcoin distributed to NFT holders each Month?**&#x20;
    1. 1/3 of all Bitcoin goes to buy new Miners for the BTC Bulls Community
    2. The remaining 2/3 is sent back to the contract where&#x20;
       1. 10% is allocated to The Core Team.
       2. 90% is distributed proportionally to the BTC Bull NFT owners.&#x20;
14. **What % will be compounded / re-invested?**&#x20;

    1/3 of all monthly rewards are generated from the BTC mining cluster.&#x20;
15. **Is there any long-term incentive to be a part of the project?** If you think Bitcoin is a promising asset to hold in the future, yes. If you think Bitcoin will drop to 0 one day, nope.
16. **Why not just send users Bitcoin and not Wrapped Bitcoin?** Bitcoin is not an ERC20 token and thus doesn't work with EVM smart contracts. The only way to bring Bitcoin into our project is to convert it to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an ERC20 token that can be used on Ethereum-based smart contracts.&#x20;
17. **Will you ever use BTC instead of Wrapped Bitcoin to pay out NFT holders?** Perhaps one day in the future. Currently, some plugins allow EVM smart contracts to work with Bitcoins' network, but from a security perspective, they are risky. Thus, we will not use them until higher adoption and more security emphasis on bridging between Ethereum and Bitcoins networks.&#x20;
18. **What is the value of WBTC?** The price of Wrapped Bitcoin is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin.&#x20;
19. **Can I sell my position in the project?** Yes, if you no longer want to be in the project, you can sell your NFTs (The Ranch BTC Bulls) on OpenSea. When doing so, there is a 12.5% royalty fee. &#x20;
