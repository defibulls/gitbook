# BTC Bulls

## MINTING NFTS

When a user elects to enter the Minting raffle when minting BTC Bull NFTs, 3% of the transaction cost is held in the Minting Raffle Fund, and the user becomes eligible to win the raffle drawing when it reaches 100 entries. Opting into the raffle is a manual and voluntary process and only allows participation in that particular drawing. If a user elects to mint 1 BTC Bull NFT or 10 BTC Bull NFTs and opts to enter the Minting Raffle, they will be entered into the raffle once. A single winner shall receive the entire Minting Raffle balance, which is then reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new BTC Bull NFTs are eligible to enter the Raffle, this doesn't matter if it's the first time a user has minted or taken part in previous Minting Raffles.&#x20;

When a user does not elect to enter the Minting Raffle, the 3% that would have gone to the Minting Raffle Fund is then passed to the BTC Miners Safe. The user will not be entered into the Minting Raffle during this transaction. Thus, they are not eligible to win it.

## HOSTING FEES

The key to the success and profitability of this project is all about the timing of the start of the project. The price of the BTC miners and the hosting/electricity fees are the key factors. In December of 2021, an S19j Pro BTC Miner cost roughly $13K. Today, due to market conditions and the onset of the bear market, that same S19j Pro BTC MIner can be purchased for nearly $3K.&#x20;

This is the prime reason the project is kicking off now and relies heavily on the bear market. We have purchased BTC miners leading up to the start of this project to vet out the sellers and hosting facilities. Anyone can buy a single miner themselves and host it at their house. For the sake of an Antminer S19j Pro 100 TH/s, the challenge for said buyer is that the Miner requires a 240v outlet and a suitable place to host it. As an owner of an Antminer s19a Pro 110 TH/s sitting in my garage now, I can tell you without a doubt that these sound like a freight train, produce way more heat than you want to deal with, and cost more in electricity than you would pay at these hosting facilities. I have to pay $0.12 (which isn't that bad in terms of the national price of electricity in the US) kWh at my home. This doesn't compare to what we can expect with flare gas locations, where we can get our electric fees down to $.070&#x20;

But what about the MAINTENANCE FEES? What is this, and why is this important? Let's play out an example of how this project will go. We start the project and sell our BTC Bull NFTs, and purchase miners. We go through the first three tiers and sell 2999 BTC Bulls. Let's assume all buyers of NFTs choose to enter the daily raffle; 89% of the minting cost would go to buying miners for the project.&#x20;

* TIER 1 = (999 \* 350) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 2 = (1000 \* 360) \* 0.89&#x20;
* TIER 3 = (1000 \* 370) \* 0.89&#x20;



BTC MINERS SAFE == ((999 \* 350) + (1000 \* 360) + (1000 \* 370 )) \* 0.89  ==  $960,888.50



The way the hosting works at the hosting facility is that they will provide us with a monthly invoice for each miner they host that is calculated like this:&#x20;

3,105watts x 24hr / 1000 = 74.52kWh

74.52kWh x 0.070$/kwh = $5.22

$5.22 x 30days = $156.60/month

The BTC MINERS SAFE is then used to purchase and build the project's BTC MINER CLUSTER. Let's assume we can purchase 100 TH/s Antminer S19s for ≈$4000 each

$960,888.50 / $4000 == ≈ 240 Antminer S19 100Th/s&#x20;

When factoring in tax or other transaction expenses, the BTC MINER CLUSTER starts off with about 240 s19j Pro miners or about 24,000 TH/s of mining power.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES THE PROJECT PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

When BTC Bulls are minted from the contract, they work and live on the grounds of The Ranch.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Farm (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As an owner of a BTC Bull(s), you are leasing the fenced plot of land, a stockyard, for your Bulls to live. Some owners will have stockyards with 1 or 2 Bulls, while others will create much larger ones. There is no limit on how many BTC Bulls can be housed within a particular stockyard. Each BTC Bull within your designated plot carries a $15 hosting fee per month. The collection of individual stockyard hosting fees goes directly to pay for the actual hosting fees of the project.&#x20;

This approach allows each BTC Bull within The Ranch to share the hosting invoice evenly. In the above example, 240 miners on the invoice would be ≈ $38,000 if we average a $156.60 hosting fee per miner. Since we have 2999 BTC Bulls in circulation, each BTC Bull NFT will share that invoice, and we would be able to retain leftover  ≈ $7,000 within the HOSTING SAFE to pay on later hosting invoices.&#x20;

Through compounding efforts, our BTC Mining Cluster has the potential to grow to a very large and powerful number. The following month we could add more miners as more Tiers sell out and our compounding efforts start. This could give us an invoice of $185,000 shared between all 9960\* BTC Bulls. With the set hosting fees for each plot, once we collected the $15 from each BTC Bull, we would still be short of paying the monthly invoice.&#x20;

$185,000 - $149,400 == $30,600 left to cover&#x20;

In this instance, we would have to convert $30,600 of our mined BTC to pay the remainder of the invoice. The rest of that mined BTC gets dispersed as monthly rewards, according to FIG 3.&#x20;

From all our projections, see [projections](projections.md), the last thing we want to do as a project is burn our mined Bitcoin to pay for hosting invoices. However, there is a delicate line between burning Bitcoin for hosting fees and having reasonable and consistent maintenance fee expectations for all BTC Bull NFT holders. &#x20;

#### HOW DOES A USER PAY THEIR HOSTING FEES FOR THEIR STOCKYARD?

Each transaction will go through this logic process when paying monthly hosting fees. If a user has enough USDC.e within their hosting reserve balance on the contract, the maintenance fee amount will be deducted from that balance. Otherwise, each user will need to pay the hosting fees from their wallet using USDC.e&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>FIG 4</p></figcaption></figure>

#### HOSTING SAFE

As noted in the Minting figures (FIG 1 and 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the HOSTING SAFE. This money is kept in the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet to pay for hosting fee invoices. Each month when users pay their stockyard hosting fees, they replenish the HOSTING SAFE balance. &#x20;

A very important concept and design feature of the project revolves around HOSTING SAFE and ensuring we keep funds in there to keep the project healthy. Every plot owner must pay the hosting fee for any BTC Bulls on the property within their plot. Every plot/stockyard owner within The Ranch has a 'Survey Clock' on their account ranging from 0-3. This represents how many pay periods can go by before The Ranch surveys its plot. A plot survey happens whenever a plot owner's account gets to zero on their survey clock.  When the survey clock does expire or gets to zero, their account is checked during the monthly pay period.&#x20;

When a plot owner's stockyard is surveyed and checked, The Ranch is looking to redeem the hosting fees due from that plot owner.  This is a normal process within our ecosystem. Essentially what we are doing is checking to see if the plot owners hosting reserve balance can cover their hosting balance. If that is the case, we pay the hosting balance for that plot owner's account for them with their hosting reserve automatically and reset their hosting balance back to 0 and survey clock to 3. If the account hosting reserve balance can not cover the hosting balance, we are forced to settle up with the account in another way. We would take the WBTC in that owner's account and send it to the HOSTING SAFE multi-sig wallet and then reset that account's hosting balances and survey clock. Essentially we are liquidating the WBTC from that user's account and will have to sell it to help pay for the project hosting fee invoices. That plots owners account also has a counter that keeps track of how many liquidations they have, which will be incremented by 1.

The key difference between our liquidation structure and other projects, such as StrongBlock, is if a user gets behind and doesn't pay their hosting fees. They wouldn't lose everything as you would have in StrongBlock. In our ecosystem, the user only forfeits the current WBTC in their account on our contract, and then they are reset back to good standing, ready to receive next month's WBTC rewards.&#x20;

Plot owners do have the option never to be checked or surveyed. The only time any account is surveyed is if their survey clock gets to zero. A user can pay bi-monthly and never let their survey clock touch zero, and thus they would never be checked using this logic flow.  This approach is a manual process and perfectly fine for users to do. We wanted more of an autopay feature for plot owners and thus created the survey clock to handle it. If users have enough in their hosting reserve balance, that account can go for a long time without being liquidated.  &#x20;

Within the project, we have built many ways a user can increase their USDC.e balances on the contract and will continue to build more as time goes on. Referring people to the project gives you 2% of their minting transaction cost. The minting raffle and the Royalty Raffle will do the same and can fund an account for a long time. Alternatively, a user can also load USDC.e into their hosting reserve balance to cover survey events.  This would allow a user always to have USDC.e in their account and avoid liquidation. As long as the user has more in their hosting reserver balance than in their hosting balance, they can't get liquidated. Users can deposit up to $1000 per transaction into their hosting reserve balance, protecting them from liquidation as far as the user wants to project it out into the future.&#x20;



## ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)RAFFLE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

#### MINTING RAFFLE

When minting new NFTs, users can voluntarily enter the Minting Raffle, where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the Raffle winner. Once 100 people enter the raffle, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund, which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC.e allowed to withdraw from the contract from that user.&#x20;

#### ROYALTY RAFFLE

There will be a 10% royalty fee when selling BTC Bulls on secondary marketplaces.  2.5% of that gets paid to the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 7.5% will be split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Raffle. Each month, this 50% will be divided equally and dispersed between up to 3 BTC Bulls. This amount will be uploaded into the USDC.e balance on the contract for those winning BTC Bulls owners. See the raffle explanation for a deeper explanation, further explanation [here](royalty-raffle.md). &#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and/or profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get anywhere close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, these raffle amounts have the potential to be special.
