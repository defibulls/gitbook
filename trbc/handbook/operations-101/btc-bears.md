# BTC Bears

## MINTING NFTs

When a user elects to enter the Minting raffle when minting BTC Bears NFTs, 3% of the transaction cost is held in the Minting Raffle Fund, and the user becomes eligible to win the Minting Raffle when it reaches 100 entries. Opting into the raffle is a manual and voluntary process and only allows participation in that particular drawing. If a user elects to mint 1 BTC Bear NFT or 10 BTC Bear NFTs and opts to enter the Minting Raffle, they will be entered into the raffle once. A single winner shall receive the entire Minting Raffle balance, which is then reset. When the Minting Raffle is reset, all users who mint new BTC Bear NFTs are eligible to enter the Raffle; this doesn't matter if it's the first time a user has minted or taken part in previous Minting Raffles.&#x20;

When a user does not elect to enter the Minting Raffle, the 3% that would have gone to the Minting Raffle Fund is then passed to the BTC Miners Safe. The user will not be entered into the Minting Raffle during this transaction. Thus, they are not eligible to win it.

## HOSTING FEES

This is where the great divide happens between the BTC Bulls and BTC Bears.  They disagree on how to pay for the hosting fees at the mining facilities.&#x20;

#### HOW DOES THE BTC BEARS COMMUNITY PAY THE HOSTING INVOICE?

BTC Bears live among The Ranch but not on The Ranch. We don't treat them like cattle and watch over them as we do the BTC Bulls. Whereas the BTC Bulls pay a $15 hosting fee, the BTC Bears do not pay any fees after minting.  This is the foundational difference between the communities. One has to decide whether to be a BTC Bull or a BTC Bear. Time will tell which side made the better choice; as of now, it's unknown to all.&#x20;

Both communities still host equipment at Compass Mining and will have monthly hosting invoices to deal with. If the BTC Bears get an invoice for $38,000, then there is only one thing to do. We must pay the entire hosting invoice with our mined BTC for the month. &#x20;

#### HOSTING SAFE

As noted in the Minting figures (FIG 1 and 2), 5% of each minting transaction will fund the HOSTING SAFE. For the BTC Bears, this acts as a war chest in times of need. We don't have any mechanism to refill it, it's simply there when we need it and gone once we use it.&#x20;

The entire raffle process is NOT controlled by the owners of the contract in any way, as we are utilizing Chainlinks VRFv2.&#x20;

* What is VRF?  Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values.

#### MINTING RAFFLE

When minting new NFTs, users can voluntarily enter the Minting Raffle, where 3% of each transaction cost is used to award the Raffle winner. Once 100 people enter the raffle, **a random participant** is selected and will receive the entire raffle fund, which will be uploaded to the amount of USDC.e allowed to withdraw from the contract from that user.&#x20;

#### ROYALTY RAFFLE

There will be a 12.5% royalty fee when selling BTC Bears on OpenSea. 2.5% of that gets paid to the marketplace as a fee. The remaining 10% will be split 50/50.&#x20;

* **50%** going back to The Ranch for project development and project-related costs.&#x20;
* **50%** goes into our monthly Royalty Raffle. Each month, this 50% will be divided equally and dispersed between 3 BTC Bears. This amount will be uploaded into the USDC.e balance on the contract for those winning BTC Bears. This is a simpler process for the BTC Bears as no logic checks need to be used if you own the BTC Bear, congrats, it's going to be a nice day.  &#x20;

Our community will be filled with holders with long-term mindsets, but there will always be those who need to sell for liquidity and/or profit opportunities. Looking at what other projects have done in the past, if we get anywhere close to a quarter of the numbers those projects hit, these raffle amounts have the potential to be special.
