13. **How will the initial The Ranch Bulls NFT funds be allocated?**&#x20;

    89% to BTC MINER FUND to buy new BTC miners, 5% to the HOSTING SAFE, which helps pay for the mining invoices at hosting facilities, 3% to Minting Raffle for new mints, and 2% to the Partner Network and 1% for marketing. &#x20;
14. **What is the percentage of bitcoin that is distributed to NFT holders each Month?**&#x20;
    1. 1/3 of all Bitcoin goes to buy new Miners for the Project&#x20;
    2. The remaining 2/3 is sent back to the contract where&#x20;
       1. 10% is allocated to The Core Team.
       2. 90% is distributed proportionally to the BTC Bull NFT owners.&#x20;

    1/3 of all monthly rewards are generated from the BTC mining cluster.&#x20;
16. **Is there any long-term incentive to be a part of the project?** If you think Bitcoin is a promising asset to hold in the future, ABSOLUTELY. If you think Bitcoin will drop to 0 one day, HECK NO.
17. **Why not just send users Bitcoin and not Wrapped Bitcoin?** Bitcoin is not an ERC20 token and thus doesn't work with EVM smart contracts. The only way to bring Bitcoin into our project is to convert it to wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), which is an ERC20 token that can be used on Ethereum-based smart contracts.&#x20;
18. **Will you ever use BTC instead of Wrapped Bitcoin to pay out NFT holders?** Perhaps one day in the future. Currently, there are plugins that allow EVM smart contracts to work with Bitcoins' network, but from a security perspective, they are risky. Thus, we will not use them until higher adoption and more security emphasis on bridging between Ethereum and Bitcoins networks.&#x20;
19. **What is the value of WBTC?** The price of Wrapped Bitcoin is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin.&#x20;
20. **Can I sell my position in the project?** Yes, if you no longer want to be in the project, you can sell your NFTs (The Ranch BTC Bulls) on the marketplace. When doing so, there is a 10% royalty fee. &#x20;
