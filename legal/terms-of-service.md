We reserve the right to introduce, withdraw, or amend websites, content, material, product offerings, or other Services without notice.

### User Submissions:

The Services may contain Interactive Services that allow users to post, submit, publish, display, or transmit User Submissions on or through the Services. All User Submissions must comply with the Content Standards in these Terms of Service. Any User Submission posted through the Services will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. By providing any User Submission, you grant us and our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns the right to use, reproduce, modify, perform, display, distribute, and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose, including for marketing purposes, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and your account settings. You represent and warrant that you own or control all rights in and to your User Submissions and have the right to grant the license granted above to us, our affiliates and service providers, and each of their and our respective licensees, successors, and assigns. You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Submissions you submit or contribute. You, not The Ranch, have full responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy, and appropriateness. We are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Submissions posted by you or any other user of the Services.

### Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination:

We have the right to remove or refuse to post any User Submissions for any reason in our sole discretion. We may take any action concerning any User Submission that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such User Submission violates the Terms of Service, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property or other rights of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or could create liability for The Ranch. We may also disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy. We may take appropriate legal action, including referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Services. We may terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for violating these Terms of Service. We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services immediately, with or without cause, with or without notice. We have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Services. However, we do not undertake to review all material before it is assigned to the Services and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for the performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section. You waive and hold harmless The Ranch and its affiliates, licensees, and service providers from any claims resulting from any action taken by any of the foregoing parties during or taken as a consequence of investigations by either such parties or law enforcement authorities.

### Content Standards:

These content standards apply to any User Submissions and use of Interactive Services. User Submissions must comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations. User Submissions must not contain any material that is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory, or otherwise objectionable. User Submissions must not promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. User Submissions must not infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other intellectual property or other rights of any other person or contain any content, materials, data, or additional information not lawfully provided to us. User Submissions must not violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations or that otherwise may conflict with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. User Submissions must not be likely to deceive anyone, promote any illegal activity, or advocate, promote, or assist any unlawful act. User Submissions must not cause annoyance, inconvenience, or needless anxiety or be likely to upset, embarrass, alarm, or annoy any other person. User Submissions must not impersonate any person or misrepresent Your identity or affiliation with any person or organization. User Submissions must not give the impression that they emanate from or are endorsed by us or any other person or entity if this is not the case.

### Copyright Infringement:

We take claims of copyright infringement seriously and will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers. If You believe any materials accessible on or from the Services infringe Your copyright, You may request the removal of those materials (or access to them) from the Services by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. To be valid in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (“DMCA”), the written notice (the “DMCA Notice”) must include substantially the following: Your physical or electronic signature, identification of the copyrighted work You believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on the Services, a representative list of such works, identification of the material You believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material, adequate information by which we can contact You (including Your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address), a statement that You have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, a statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, a statement, under penalty of perjury, that You are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

### Reliance on Information:

The information provided on or through the Services is intended solely for general information. We do not guarantee this information's accuracy, completeness, or usefulness. Your reliance on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other user (whether registered or a guest) of the Services or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents. The Services may contain content provided by third parties, including materials provided by other third-party service providers, financial institutions, and/or other users. All statements and/or opinions expressed in these materials, and all articles and responses to questions and other content other than the content provided by The Ranch, are solely the opinions and responsibility of the person or entity providing those materials. These materials do not necessarily reflect the opinion of The Ranch. We are not responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any materials provided by any third parties.

You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to these terms. If you do not agree with or review the applicable terms for online purchases, do not make any purchases through the Services.

### Links from the Service; Third Parties

&#x20;Links to other sites and resources provided by third parties on the Services are for your convenience only. This includes links in any third-party product marketplaces and advertisements, including banner and sponsored links. We have no control over the contents of those third-party sites or resources and accept no responsibility for them or any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any third-party websites linked to the Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and subject to the terms and conditions of use and privacy policies applicable to such websites. You acknowledge and agree to comply with all terms and conditions of use and privacy policies applicable to all third parties whose services interoperate with or are accessed from the Services.

### Disclaimer of Warranties

You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to meet your requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data. Your use of the Services, its content, and any functions or items obtained through the Services is at your own risk. The Services, the Websites, their content, and any functions or items obtained through the Services, including without limitation the Ranch NFTs, are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Neither the Ranch nor any person associated with the Ranch makes any warranty or representation concerning the Services' completeness, security, reliability, quality, accuracy, or availability. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Ranch nor anyone associated with the Ranch represents or warrants that the Services, the Websites, their content, or any functions or items obtained through the Services will be accurate, reliable, error-free, or uninterrupted, that defects will be corrected, that our services or the server(s) that makes them available are free of viruses or other harmful components, or that the Websites or any other functions or items obtained through the Services will otherwise meet your needs or expectations. To the fullest extent provided by law, the Ranch hereby disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. The foregoing does not affect any warranties that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.



### Limitation on Liability:

The Ranch, its affiliates, licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors will not be liable for any damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with your use or inability to use the services, the websites, any websites linked to them, or any content of the services or other websites. Such damages include but are not limited to direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, such as personal injury, pain, and suffering, emotional distress, loss of revenue, profits, business or anticipated savings, use, goodwill, or data, whether caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract, or otherwise, even if foreseeable. This limitation of liability does not apply to liability resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct. The total aggregate liability of The Ranch will not exceed the amount paid by you to The Ranch in the twelve months before the accrual of the claim. The Ranch has made the services available to you in reliance on the limitations of liability in this section 16 and the disclaimer of warranties in section 15, without which The Ranch would not be able to offer the services.

### Indemnification:

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless The Ranch, its affiliates, licensors, service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Service or your use of the Services, including but not limited to your User Submissions, any use of the Services’ content, functions, and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Service, or your use of any information obtained from the Services.

### Arbitration; Waiver of Trial by Jury&#x20;

You agree that all disputes between you and us or any of our officers, directors, or employees acting in their capacity as such (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) concerning your relationship with us, including disputes related to these terms of service, your use of the services, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the JAMS, Inc. (“JAMS”) rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes. You and we hereby expressly waive the trial by jury. However, you or we may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any state or federal court having jurisdiction to grant it in case of an actual or threatened infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit. Other rights you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.

### Small Claims Court; Class Action Waiver

Alternatively, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if such claim is within such court’s jurisdiction unless such action is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims this agreement covers. You are giving up your right to participate as a class representative or member on any class claim you may have against us, including, without limitation, any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity or consolidated claims involving another person’s account if we are a party to the proceeding.

### Procedures:&#x20;

These dispute resolution provisions will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. If JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 160 days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have the authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with these terms of service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to, or connected with the use of the services or these terms of service must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.



### 30-Day Opt-Out Period:

If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this Disputes section, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms of Service (unless a longer period is required by applicable law). You must then litigate any disputes against us in accordance with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction section below. Your written notification must be mailed to the address at the end of these Terms of Service. Failure to notify us within this period means you agree to be bound by the terms of this Disputes section, including the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and any revisions we make to these Terms of Service after your first acceptance. Your notification must include (i) Your name; (ii) Your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your ability to participate in a class action. If we make any changes to this Disputes section (other than a change to the address for notices or rejections of future changes), you may reject the such change by sending a written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. If you have correctly opted out within the first thirty (30) days, sending a rejection of a future change is unnecessary. Failure to opt out means you agree to arbitrate any dispute in accordance with this Disputes section, as modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent according to this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; it does not affect other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements between you and us.

Severability: If any prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable, then all preceding language in this Disputes section will be null and void. However, this Disputes section, including the arbitration agreement and class-action waivers, will survive the termination of your relationship with us.



### Governing Law and Jurisdiction:

The Services and these Terms of Service, including any dispute or claim arising from or related to them (including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Georgia or any other jurisdiction). Any legal action, suit, or proceeding related to these Terms of Service or the Services shall only be brought in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Georgia. By accepting these Terms of Service, You consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objections to exercising jurisdiction over You and to venue in such courts.

### Waiver and Severability:

Any waiver by The Ranch of any term or condition in these Terms of Service shall not be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. The Ranch's failure to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except for Section 19.5, if any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.

### Entire Agreement:&#x20;

These Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between You and The Ranch concerning the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, regarding the Services.
