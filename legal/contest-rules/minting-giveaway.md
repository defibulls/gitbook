\
(b) Alternative Means of Entry. As an alternative means of entry in the Promotion, entrants that have a Polygon Account may submit mail-in entries in the form of a self-addressed, stamped envelope that contains the AMOE Registration Data, as defined below:\
For each properly submitted AMOE Entry Envelope, the entrant shall receive one (1) entry into the Minting Sweepstakes in which the Minting Window is specified with the correct gate code on the entry form. To complete an AMOE Entry Envelope, contestants must type or legibly write the following information:&#x20;

* Full Name
* Discord name (include #XXXXX)
* Their respective Polygon Account Address

All AMOE Entry Envelopes must be postmarked by the ending time of the selected promotional window to be eligible to receive Entries in the Prize drawing. Any improperly submitted AMOE Entry Envelopes (i.e., any potential AMOE Entry Envelopes having invalid or incomplete AMOE Registration Data) will be VOID.\
\
(c) Entry Limits/General Provisions. The total combined number of entries submitted per promotional window may not extend one(1). So, by way of example, if an entrant obtains one entrance via minting a BTC Bull or BTC Bear,  AMOE Entry Tickets during the Promotion Period will not be permitted. Any Entries attempted in excess of this limitation will be discarded. Any attempt by any individual to obtain more than the permitted number of Entries by the AMOE Entry Method by using multiple/different Polygon Accounts, e-mail addresses, mobile devices, identities, registrations, user-names, or any other method, will void all of that individual’s Entries and that individual will be disqualified from participating in the Promotion. Use of any automated system to participate in the Promotion is prohibited and will result in disqualification. Sponsor reserves the right to reject any Entry that it believes, in its sole and reasonable discretion, is fraudulent, incomplete, or otherwise invalid. Sponsor is not responsible for Entries, Promotion-related notifications, claims, or notices that are lost, late, illegible, misdirected, damaged, incomplete, or incorrect. Entrants are not permitted to sell, barter, exchange or otherwise transfer Entries to/with any other individual and/or entity.\
\
**IDENTIFICATION OF ENTRANTS:**\
Each entry will be identified by the applicable entrant’s Polygon Account address, as collected and stored in the Promotion Database. For purposes of these Contest Rules, the “Promotion Database” is defined as the entire list of valid Entries generated during the Promotion Period windows described above. \

**HOW TO WIN A PRIZE:**\
The potential Prize winners will be notified on the official “The Ranch” discord page. If the winner entered the promotion via minting BTC Bulls or BTC Bears, the winning amount of $595 would be deposited into the udsc awards for that address. If a winner is chosen from an AMOE Entry Ticket, the winner has five days to prove ownership of the polygon account. If the said winner of the AMOE Entry Ticket does not prove ownership within this time frame, the winning amount will be lost and placed into the next promotion window balance to award. \

In addition, each potential Prize winner may be required to provide picture proof of identification, which may include a driver’s license, passport, voting card or similar government-issued identification, and proof that she/he is the entrant that submitted the applicable winning Entry.\
\
Non-compliance by a potential Prize winner within this time may result in forfeiture of the subject Prize. The return of a Prize and/or Prize notification as undeliverable may result in forfeiture of that Prize. In no case shall Sponsor be liable in any manner where a potential Prize winner has not received notification sent from Sponsor or where Sponsor fails to receive a response from a potential Prize winner within the required response period. The winning Entry, as well as the associated information of the potential Prize winner, must identically match the records maintained by Sponsor and Administrator in order for a Prize to be awarded.
